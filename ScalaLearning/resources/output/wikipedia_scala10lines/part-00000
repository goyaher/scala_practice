Conceived as the sixth entry in the ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' series, ''Dead Sun'' entered production for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox 360]], but was cancelled in 2012 following three years of work, and initially remained undisclosed to the public.

It is one of the [[List of political parties in Croatia|two major contemporary political parties in Croatia]], along with the [[centre-left]] [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP). It is currently the second-largest party in the Croatian Parliament with 41 seats. HDZ ruled Croatia from 1990 to 2000 and, in coalition with junior partners, from 2003 to 2011. The party is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP).  ==History==  ===Origins=== The HDZ was founded in 17 June 1989 by Croatian dissidents led by [[Franjo Tuđman]]. When the party was founded, the multi-party system in Croatia was at an embryonic stage. The HDZ was founded in an almost conspiratorial manner, and its first offices were in a Zagreb shack. Because of that the party founders proudly call themselves ''barakaši'' - from "baraka", which is the Croatian word for "shack".  President Tuđman and other HDZ officials traveled abroad and gathered large financial contributions from Croatian expatriates.  On the eve of the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 elections]], the ruling [[Croatian Communist Party]] saw such tendencies within the HDZ as an opportunity to remain in power. At the beginning of democracy the communists called HDZ "the party of dangerous intentions". At the elections this proved to be miscalculation, because 41.9% of Croatian voters saw the chance to be free from communism and [[Yugoslavia]], but also as the proper answer to Serb nationalism, embodied in part by [[Slobodan Milošević]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The HDZ won a majority in the Croatian Parliament, and Croatia became one of the few countries of Eastern Europe where Communist single party rule was replaced by anti-Communist single party rule. May 30, 1990 - the day the HDZ formally took power - was later celebrated as Statehood Day, a public holiday in Croatia.  ===Tuđman presidency=== [[File:FranjoTudman.JPG|thumb|right|[[Franjo Tuđman]], former [[Croatian President]] and HDZ Founder]]  The [[Croatian presidential election, 1992|presidential elections]] followed in 1992 and Tuđman, who would remain as undisputed party leader until his death in 1999, was elected president.  The party ruled Croatia throughout the 1990s and under its leadership, Croatia became independent (1991), was internationally recognised (1992), and consolidated all of its pre-war territory (by 1998). During that period, the HDZ won both the 1992 and 1995 parliamentary elections.  As it strongly advocated Croatian independence, the HDZ was quite unpopular with the [[Serb]] minority, and others who preferred to see [[Croatia]] remain inside the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. This was one of the factors contributing to the creation of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] and the subsequent armed conflict in neighbouring [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. The role of the HDZ in those events is matter of controversy, even in Croatia, where some tend to view HDZ policy in the early stages of the conflict as extremist and a contributing factor in the escalation of violence, while others (such as [[Marko Veselica]]'s [[Croatian Democratic Party]]) see the HDZ as having appeased [[Serbia]] and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], and therefore, being responsible for Croatia being unprepared for defence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Špegelj|first=Martin|title=Sjećanja vojnika|year=2001|publisher=Znanje|location=Zagreb|isbn=953-195-190-X|edition=1. izd.}}</ref> However, the policies of Tuđman and the HDZ shifted according to the circumstances.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}  === Transition to capitalism ===  The HDZ also began to lead Croatia toward [[post-Communism|political and economic transition]] from communism to capitalism. Notably, HDZ governments implemented [[privatization]] in the country, in a manner that critics consider sub-optimal, and at times possibly illegal, due to the selective nature of the [[nationalization]]s (see [[Croatian privatization controversy]]). According to the HDZ, this process proved a useful distraction from dealing with the baggage of post World War II communist nationalizations. In fact it was the HDZ in 1992 which enacted into law the right of [[corporation]]s (the vast majority of which were under state ownership) the right to finally formally register themselves as the owners of nationalized property, thus completing their own version of a process of quasi-nationalization started by the communist regime after WWII, in different targeted areas for their own gain.  As a result of these, and other, schemes, that had been planned before the break-up of Yugoslavia, many "[[tycoon]]s" emerged in a pattern of state-sponsored loans brokered with HDZ influence, with the purpose of dissolving state ownership. This model was widely abused, not only by the HDZ, but also by other political parties.  Not all of the nationalized property was dealt with in this way. The property of those who could lobby the HDZ, or who had substantial influence in Croatian politics, was returned without much delay, while others had to wait for justice. Property returned included possessions nationalized from the [[Catholic Church in Croatia|Catholic Church]] or from widely known individuals such as Gavrilović, the owner of a major meat-producing factory in [[Petrinja]], south of Zagreb. Restitution for land seized during the break-up of Yugoslavia is still of great public concern.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}  ===HDZ after Tuđman's death=== {{Politics of Croatia}} All this, together with Tuđman's death in December 1999, had an impact on the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary elections]]. Although the HDZ remained the largest single party, it was defeated by a left-centre coalition of six opposition parties and many saw the large turnout as a referendum against the HDZ, just as the 1990 elections had been seen as a referendum on Communism and Yugoslavia. This impression was underlined at the subsequent [[Croatian presidential election, 2000|presidential election]], when the HDZ candidate [[Mate Granić]], heavily favoured to win, finished third and therefore failed to enter the second round of voting, won by [[Stjepan Mesić|Stipe Mesić]].  In the period from 2000 and 2003, several businessmen who became tycoons under the initial HDZ rule were tried and convicted for alleged abuses, though in general the privatization process implemented by the HDZ remained unaltered.  This period proved to be a low point for the HDZ and many thought that party could not recover. Those included Mate Granić, who, together with [[Vesna Škare-Ožbolt]], left to form the centre-right [[Democratic Centre (Croatia)|Democratic Centre]] (DC).  The HDZ began to recover when the [[ICTY|International Criminal Tribunal]] began to prosecute [[Croatian Army]] commanders, thus provoking a major backlash among the Croatian public. Popular discontent manifested itself in mass rallies as the public came to terms with the changes in the party and its policies. Although the HDZ, and its new leader [[Ivo Sanader]], took part in those events and supported the protests, they gradually began to distance themselves from the more extreme rhetoric, becoming perceived as moderates. This tendency continued when the [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] shifted rightwards, making Sanader's HDZ appear centrist in comparison. This process was completed in 2002 when [[Ivić Pašalić]], leader of the HDZ hardliners and perceived to be associated with the worst excesses of Tuđman's era, challenged Sanader for the party leadership, accusing him of betraying Tuđman's nationalist legacy. At first it looked that Sanader would lose, but with the help of [[Branimir Glavaš]] and the tacit support of liberal sections of Croatian public opinion, he won at the party convention. Pašalić then left the HDZ to form the [[Croatian Bloc (political party)|Croatian Bloc]] party.  This allowed Sanader to present the HDZ as a "reforming" party, one that would completely face what they had created, purged of some of the more controversial aspects of the Tuđman legacy, and to convince the public that returning the HDZ to power would not jeopardise democratic standards in Croatia. As such, the HDZ started to be perceived as a credible democratic alternative to the government of [[Ivica Račan]], then plagued by the same indecision, inefficiency, corruption and factional struggles, though it was the tip of the iceberg with much more to come.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}  ===First Sanader government 2003–2008=== [[File:Sanader cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Ivo Sanader]], president of the Croatian Democratic Union from 2000 - 2009]] At the [[Croatian parliamentary elections, 2003|legislative elections of November 2003]], the party won 33.9% of the popular vote and 66 out of 151 seats. Although it failed to win a clear majority in the [[Croatian Parliament]], even with the help of the allied DC and HSLS, it formed a government with the nominally left-wing [[Independent Democratic Serb Party]] and the [[Croatian Party of Pensioners]].  With such a broad and diverse mandate, the Sanader-led government vigorously pursued policies that amounted to the implementation of the basic criteria for joining the [[European Union]], such as the return of refugees to their homes, rebuilding houses damaged in the war, improving minority rights by including minority representatives in the government, cooperating with the ICTY, and continuing to consolidate the Croatian economy. Despite this, the EU's Council of Ministers postponed Croatia's membership negotiations with the union on the grounds of its non-cooperation with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] over the case of indicted general [[Ante Gotovina]].  This setback brought an increase in [[Eurosceptic]] views among the Croatian public, which also affected support for the HDZ. Since accession to the EU was a key part of Sanader's reformist course, opposition to his leadership within and outside HDZ was on the rise. This opposition manifested itself at the 2005 local elections and the defection of Glavaš, who not only successfully challenged Sanader's authority but also managed to nominally deprive Sanader of his parliamentary majority.  ===Second Sanader government 2008-2009===  Despite this defeat, the first Sanader led government was able to survive until the end of the legislature. The subsequent [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary election]] in late November 2007 saw the HDZ hard-pressed both by the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]-led leftist coalition and by the extreme right wing [[Croatian Party of Rights]] and [[Croatian Democratic Assembly of Slavonia and Baranja]].  During the electoral campaign a vigorous and sometimes ruthless reaction from the party and Sanader himself, together with some capital errors from SDP, convinced part of the far right electorate to support the HDZ in order to prevent what they perceived as the heirs of the former [[Communism|communist]] party to return to power.<ref>[http://www.javno.com/en-croatia/vote-for-hsp-is-vote-for-sdp---sanader_82105 Vote for HSP Is Vote for SDP – Sanader - Current Events - Croatia - Dalje.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.studiacroatica.org/bol2007/20070912_diaspora.htm PM: Nobody Will Take Away Votes from Diaspora<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The party won a majority of both seats and votes in the election, and the first session of the newly elected parliament was called for 11 January 2008. However, the SDP repeatedly refused to acknowledge defeat, claiming that they had the most votes if the [[Diaspora]] ballot was not taken into account. The HDZ gained the support of the "yellow green coalition" (HSS-HSLS) and of the HSU and [[national minorities]] representatives, and so a second government, still led by [[Ivo Sanader]], was formed.  Although that government had a larger majority than the former one, its existence remained troubled, because of the worsening of the previously good economic situation and a [[weariness]] of Croatian public opinion about what was felt to be an overly long HDZ rule.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Another major drawback was the [[Slovenia]]n blocking of several chapters of Croatia's EU accession terms, until border disputes between the two countries had been settled.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Although this ultimately lead to an indefinite suspension of the Croatian [[European Union|EU]] accession negotiations, it had no impact on the government's popularity. In this case, as would be expected, considering Croatian staunch [[patriotism]] and national [[self-consciousness]], all parties and nearly every Croatian [[citizen]] were absolutely adamant in refusing at any cost any concessions over matters of [[national interest]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}  In [[Croatian local elections, 2009|the general local elections]] held in May 2009, the HDZ, against all expectations, managed to grow again, coming ahead of the SDP.<ref>[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2009/05/21/feature-03 Croatia's local elections head to second round (SETimes.com)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, HDZ support did weaken in the larger cities.  On 1 July 2009, Ivo Sanader abruptly announced his resignation from politics and appointed [[Jadranka Kosor]] as his successor. She was confirmed as the new leader of the party on 4 July, and was appointed by president Stipe Mesic as the prime minister-designate. Two days later the [[Sabor]] confirmed Kosor as the new [[Prime Minister of Croatia|prime minister]], the first woman to hold the position.  In the same resignation speech, Sanader also appointed [[Andrija Hebrang (son)|Andrija Hebrang]], who had formerly held the posts of [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|defence minister]] and [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Croatia)|health minister]], as HDZ candidate for the incoming [[Croatian presidential election, 2009-2010|presidential election]], so decreasing any speculation about his own ambitions for that position.  ===Government of Jadranka Kosor=== [[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Summit March 2010 (43).jpg|thumb|[[Jadranka Kosor]], president of the Croatian Democratic Union from 2009 until 2012]] The HDZ was faced with bad poll ratings and a large clean-up task that was still underway when Sanader left. The officials used the 2009 convention to elect Jadranka Kosor the party president by acclamation, and proceeded to make various unpopular measures to tackle the economic crisis. [[Andrija Hebrang (son)|Andrija Hebrang]] accepted his designation as the presidential candidate only at the end of July, after he underwent a thorough [[medical examination]], to exclude any remaining trace of a previous [[carcinoma]].  The Kosor government remained mostly unchanged from the previous Sanader government, but the HDZ suffered some internal turmoil as ministers [[Berislav Rončević]] and [[Damir Polančec]] left their posts after allegations of corruption.   In the next presidential elections, Croatia was looking for a replacement for [[Stipe Mesić]] who had held the position for ten years. But Hebrang finished third, failing to reach the second stage in which SDP candidate [[Ivo Josipović]] overwhelmingly defeated former SDP member [[Milan Bandić]].  However, many Croatian people were dissatisfied with the government, and protested on the streets against the HDZ government, demanding that new elections be held as soon as possible. The police placed a guard on [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb|St. Mark's Square]], to prevent civilians from entering.<ref>[http://danas.net.hr/hrvatska/page/2011/02/27/0033006.html Hrvatska ključa - spremaju se novi prosvjedi - Danas.hr<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  From 26 October 2011 [[USKOK]] expanded its investigation about "Slush Funds" on Croatian Democratic Union as legal entity.<ref name=CaparToma>Capar, Luka; Toma, Ivanka.

Later, the party described itself as [[centre-right]] and [[Christian Democrat]]. However, the only official ideology was [[nationalism]]. In practice, this policy saw the powerful defence minister [[Gojko Šušak]], head of the HDZ hardline faction, win Tuđman's favour. [[Stjepan Mesić]] and [[Josip Manolić]], Tuđman's associates opposed to such tendencies, left the party in 1994 and formed the [[Croatian Independent Democrats]]. These tendencies were toned down after the end of the war and the HDZ, concerned with more mundane aspects of politics, became a mainly [[social conservative]] party.  The end of war and reintegration of Croatian territory also switched Croatian people's attention from independence and foreign relations to the more mundane issues of the economy and living standards. In the late 1990s this coincided with Tuđman's illness, which sparked bitter succession struggles between various factions within the HDZ. These factions fought using friendly media and by leaking compromising information about their opponents' roles in the shadier aspects of privatisation. This, as well as Tuđman's mishandling of the [[Zagreb Crisis]], did much to undermine HDZ credibility.  ==Election history==  ===Legislative=== The following is a summary of the party's results in legislative elections for the [[Croatian Parliament]].

And that the solution is to change the namespace to "discussion"?  Even worse, are people serious in renaming '''both''' to "collaboration" or something likewise obfuscatory and multi-syllabic?!  That's pretty surprising, so I apologize for my incredulity.  It seems to be much easier to change the site CSS to say "talk" than change every single link and mention of the talk namespace in order to satisfy our sense of superiority.  The only cogent argument I can see against using "talk" is that it mischaracterized what actually goes on in talk pages--we don't "talk", we write.  But that seems needlessly pedantic.  I guess we can chalk this up to the community's willingness to accept the status quo because they are used to it, consequences for new users be damned.

I oppose for reasons of dignity and the value of description.  "Discussion" is a nicely dignified word, appropriate for the prominent position given to it on each article in this encyclopedia.  "Talk", in the sense of discussion, as opposed to exposition or demonstration, seems quite the opposite. And "discussion" is a better descriptor, in part because "talk" can only clearly have a sense which is general for the page.  Click on the "discussion" link and you are brought to a page which hosts a discussion, a particular discussion.  You are not brought to a page which hosts a talk, unless one takes "talk" in an obscure sense for such a usage. Even in the case of their general senses, "discussion" seems to be a better descriptor. What happens, or is supposed to happen, on the page, "discussion" accurately describes that; and that is a discursive conversation in any medium focused on a particular matter.   "Talk" can have a sense which can refer to such a thing by subsuming it under a more general heading, but as such it does not pick out it so specifically.  Lastly, "talk" having many other senses, if it is taken in these, it is prevented from referring to such as "discussion" does.

While the threat of this legislation still looms, the brief reprieve gives our community time to reach a meaningful consensus about whether to take action, and what action to take.  === Background information === The [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] ("SOPA", H.R.3261) is a piece of proposed federal legislation in the United States.  The bill would expand the ability of law enforcement and copyright holders to fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods.  It has seen [[Stop_Online_Piracy_Act#Opposition|widespread opposition]] from all corners of the Internet, and poses a [[Wikipedia:SOPA#The_legal_understanding|unique threat]] to Wikipedia's continued operation.  Two proposals for a response from the Wikipedia community have been advanced so far ([[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_80#Participation_in_anti-SOPA_and_anti-PIPA_protests_by_blacking_out_the_Wikipedia_logo_for_one_day_.28TOMORROW.2C_NOV._16th.29|first proposal]], [[Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)#Turn_Wikipedia_off_RfC|second proposal]]), but neither was conducted with enough lead-time to reach a meaningful consensus.  === Proposal === Here is a proposal that we believe strikes a reasonable compromise, chosen as a moderate sampling of the ideas posted on [[Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative#Action_By_the_Wikipedia_Community|Wikipedia:SOPA initiative]]:  * '''Triggering event:''' When SOPA has passed committee and is scheduled for a floor vote in either the House or Senate.  The banner runs for the week before the vote, and switches to the blackout on the day before. * '''Scope:''' Response is geotargeted to United States IP addresses only * '''Duration:''' Maximum of 7 days for banner component, maximum of 24 hours for blackout component.  Blackout is triggered on the business day before the vote.  If the vote is on a Monday, blackout runs for 24 hours starting Friday. * '''Action (banner):''' Banners encourage people to contact their Senators and Representatives (priority given to whichever is urgent, House or Senate). ** To the maximum extent possible, readers are given instant information on how they can take action. Campaign is designed to mobilize the public maximally. ** The focus is on generating high-value congressional contacts (phone calls and in-person contacts vs letters or emails) ** A VOIP-based callback system (such as the [http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/11/17/to-combat-sopa-tumblr-generates-87834-phone-calls-to-u-s-representatives/ one used recently by tumblr]) is an option if we can find one that fits our needs and allows us to remain acceptably independent. ** Banners operate like the fundraising banners (served via CentralNotice, can be closed per-user, etc). * '''Action (blackout):''' All requests are answered with a black page.  The page is semi-protected Wikitext.  Once the page is displayed, a cookie is set which prevents its display again.  Exact wording to be decided, but it hits the following points: ** SOPA puts Wikipedia, and the rest of the free Internet, at risk ** You can help by contacting your representative and senators (with maximally easy help with ways to do that) ** A "Learn more about SOPA" link which points to the relevant article on the English Wikipedia ** A "Why am I seeing this" link which points to a page detailing the process for reaching this consensus ** A link to click through to the originally requested page ** "You will only see this page once"  This gets the message across clearly, explains how to help, is targeted to people who have the ability to effect change, shows that the protest was a community decision, and doesn't reduce the utility of Wikipedia for readers.  To set this proposal in the context of similar actions in the past, see [[m:Project-wide protests|this summary]].  === Need ===  While most of us understand the power that Wikipedia has in this situation and the size of our audience, some are still skeptical that a citizen response can change the course of this legislation.  Rep. Zoe Lofgren, member of the House Judiciary Committee [http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nfhhy/member_of_house_judiciary_committee_ama_on_sopa/ addressed this concern on Reddit]:  <blockquote>My best assessment is that most members of the House who do not serve on the Judiciary Committee have not yet focused on SOPA. People should realize that incredible power they have to impact the thinking of their own Representative on the subject. For example, a very intelligent colleague who is not on the Committee approached me today asking about the bill. Why? He had received an urgent and forthright telephone call from a small business person in his district who is tremendously opposed. He wanted to know more about our Open Act Alternative. This is the power that each of you have with your own Representative. --Rep. Zoe Lofgren</blockquote>  === Statement in opposition === (replacement oppose statement by [[User: Wehwalt]])  I have replaced the original oppose statement, by the proponent, as it omitted a number of points made by opposers.  Accordingly, while nominally having both sides presented, it actually failed to do so.   No one has shown that SOPA is a threat to Wikipedia.  That is, events after its passage would cause the site to shut down or significantly impair its functioning.  When pressed, Geoff Bingham, corporate counsel to WMF (that is, they are the client, to whom his duty runs, not us) said that we might be deemed an internet search engine  This seems to contradict the plain meaning of the statute, which refers to internet search engine returning a list of sites elsewhere on the internet in return to a user query.  We do not send people elsewhere on the internet.  For the position Geoff expresses to prevail (he qualifies his position by many a “could” and “might”), the language in the statute would have to be considered meaningless--and by the rules of statutory construction, courts dislike concluding that Congress inserted language, and meant nothing by it. All that is perfectly proper; it is routine for those arguing that a statute is wrong to present what is called in the law the “parade of horribles”.  Suffice it to say that for most statutes, the parade of horribles presented by opponents resembles your favorite post-nuclear scenario.  Let’s say I’m wrong and SOPA is applicable to Wikipedia.  What does that mean?  Well, it means if a rights holder sued a foreign infringing site (that is, a site that neither has an office nor a designated person who can be served with legal process in the US, who commits various infringing acts), and won the Federal Court lawsuit, we might be asked to take down links to that site.  In most cases, these are torrent farms which give the latest episode of HBO’s hits or new movies.  Few are reliable sites.  In practice, what I suspect is that the site would be placed on the spam blacklist at meta and people would search to ensure we weren’t relying on the content.  Unlikely, that.  If we sourced to such a site, we would find another site for the citation.  I find it very unlikely, despite the parade of horribles presented by advocates, that we would lose any content.  There is no reliable source from some obscure African nation which “just happens” to be a foreign infringing site.  Absent the existential threat to Wikipedia, which many have claimed but none survived the cold light of day, we should not do this thing.  Keep in mind that having the 5th-most trafficked website in the world advocate for a cause is a tempting platform, and many have already flooded in to make the decision for us.  Keep in mind that this is something we can do at most once with any conviction (we may already have shot our bolt with the coverage of Jimbo’s call).  The second time, even for a real threat, it’s just “There goes Wikipedia again.”  (and soon “There goes Wikipedia”)  To say that this will end the Internet as we know it, as some supporters have, is dramatic, and not supported by the facts.  However, it may be a step towards making Wikipedia less-well-regarded.  Editors should feel free to advocate in the manner they deem best as individuals.  However, a strike is a bad idea.  Let’s keep in mind that SOPA is widely supported because there is a very real problem with anything copyrighted showing up on the internet, free, and being downloaded.  Many of these sites are offshore, and rightsholders cannot effectively get in touch with them to get the content taken down.  They are, at best, playing whack-a-mole.  That is a problem that is going to be addressed legislatively in some way.  But let’s say we went ahead and did this crazy thing.  What then?  Will people searching for information go and drop everything and call their congressman.  No.  They will say a word the civility hawks around here wouldn’t like, and go on to find the information, either from a mirror site or elsewhere.  And they will remember they don’t need Wikipedia to find information.  In an earlier post, I recalled James Hogan’s science fiction novel, ''The Two Faces of Tomorrow''.  In it, a self-aware computer was tested by having its power shut off.  Eventually, it managed to wire around the switch.  So will our public, and as a political player we will be trusted less.  === Rebuttal to opposition ===  Because in 2009 I wrote [[strategy:Proposal:Wikipedia is a Web search engine]], I disagree with Wehwalt.  Any serious educational or academic user does not cite Wikipedia directly, but only its sources; thus, to us, Wikipedia is a resource that delivers HTML links to references in response to a search term.  WMF lawyers might dispute this, perhaps even win, because the law doesn't always make sense, but let's not kid ourselves - how often is a law interpreted more narrowly than what it looks like?  A court order does not simply mean that we "are asked to take down links to the site"; it means that there must be consequences of some sort for failing to do so.  Wikipedia was ''unable'' to prevent postings of the [[AACS key]] when that controversy was current, despite some admins believing them to be illegal and taking action to block them.  They turned up all over the place, in articles, discussions, as screenshots of T-shirt sites, in RGB color values for a "free speech flag" (see article) - it was simply impracticable.  So we're not being set up to experience some "minor" act of distasteful censorship, but rather, for the legal sanctions of failure.  And there's ''no'' way to stop that in an encyclopedia that anyone can edit.  ===Response to Geoff=== (added post, response to Geoff)  I’d first like to apologize to the community for a number of grammar and style errors in my above post.  I would have changed them, but with a reply on table, that doesn’t seem appropriate.  I’m grateful to Geoff for responding, as his time here has value, unlike mine.  He also is putting his name and reputation on the line, I’m just posting (or being a troll, in some eyes).  As a lawyer who has concentrated in certain areas (not intellectual property!) I know that the hardest person to persuade is the lawyer from another field who drops in, makes elementary mistakes, and just doesn’t get “the big picture”.  If that suits me, I apologize for it.  However, I don’t think I would pound the drum like this without having some reason.  A poster below disparages Geoff’s reply on the ground he has ignored technical definitions of the word “indexed” with respect to search engines, which operate to exclude Wikipedia.  If Geoff has more to say on this (I will understand if he does not, his time is valuable and taken up with matters which would benefit the project), I’d be grateful for a response.  If “indexed” is clearly defined or understood to have a meaning, which excludes Wikipedia, let’s wrap this up and get back to wrapping presents for Jimbo.  At the present time, if I read Geoff’s response correctly, we are called upon to take action.  And why?  Out of fear of sloppy legislative drafting.  I grant his point that it is possible to make an argument that we are a search engine, that we do provide external links in many articles, and so some well-paid and articulate attorney can make a case that we are a search engine.  The lawyer might not actually believe it (the practice of law involves advocating for clients, although a lawyer’s personal views might differ) but the case could be made.  But come on, is the search engine argument a winning one?  Really?  Not just one that is plausible, one that can win, or at least have a solid chance thereof, in court?  That Wikipedia is a search engine?  Really?  I think the difficulty with Geoff’s post, leaving aside the question of “indexed” which may dispose of the whole thing, is in his argument that we may fit the part of the definition of search engine in that it may be claimed that our primary purpose is “gathering and reporting, in response to a user query, indexed information or Web sites available elsewhere on the Internet.”  This seems dubious. Many of our articles, especially at the higher grades, have few online sources, working from scholarly books and other print reliable sources.  My latest project, [[Cross of Gold speech]] has nearly no online references, but is almost entirely sourced to well-regarded books on the Gilded Age. We give the reader information, not distinguishing between offline and online information. Yes, we do contain information available elsewhere (i.e., off Wiki) on the internet, but really, is a judge going to rule that it is our one and only “primary purpose”?  That this is the raison d'être  of Wikipedia, the reason it has become the 5th most trafficked website in the world?  Because we are (arguably) an external search engine?  I would respectfully suggest that this is unlikely to be a winning argument, not in a court of law. Really, do you think any judge is going to rule that Wikipedia’s single primary purpose is being a search engine for sites outside  our domain?  I’ve seen judges do many ill-advised things in my time, so I never say never.  However, if we are to live in fear of what seems an unnatural interpretation of the statute--we might as well hide in the basement until they come for us.  I do not say Geoff is wrong in calling SOPA a threat.  Indeed, I am certain that we are in agreement on much of this.  I recall a saying that everyone’s in danger when the legislature’s in session.  But there doesn’t seem to be much here.  Yes, SOPA bears watching, unexpected things can come out of manager’s amendments and conference committees.  But right now the threat is not existential.  It’s at best--or, if you prefer, at worst--foggy.  @Geoff--regarding last statement, well said.  Have a good flight and best wishes of the season.--[[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]] ([[User talk:Wehwalt|talk]]) 19:45, 23 December 2011 (UTC)  ==="Internet search engine"===  I want to thank Wehwalt for his thoughtful essay.  As I noted in my [http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/12/13/how-sopa-will-hurt-the-free-web-and-wikipedia/ blog], I think the biggest flaw in SOPA for Wikimedia is the loose definition of "internet search engine."  Because this has been discussed above and elsewhere, let me explain in a little more detail why, in my opinion, rights owners will argue that that statutory definition covers us.    Under the new SOPA version (before the markup), the full definition of "internet search engine" (Sec. 101(15)) read as follows:   ::"The term 'Internet search engine'-- :::(A) means a service made available via the Internet whose primary function is gathering and reporting, in response to a user query, indexed information or Web sites available elsewhere on the Internet; and  :::(B) does not include a service that retains a third party that is subject to service of process in the United States to gather, index, or report information available elsewhere on the Internet."  Section (A) arguably applies to Wikipedia because Wikipedia is:   :(1) "a service made available via the Internet"  [There should be no dispute here.]   :(2) "whose primary function is gathering and reporting ... indexed information ... available elsewhere on the Internet"<ref>It is unclear whether the phrase "available elsewhere on the Internet" modifies the phrase "indexed information" as opposed to modifying only "Web sites."  I am assuming it modifies both phrases, though there is arguable ambiguity on this point.</ref>  [Rights owners may argue that the primary function on Wikipedia is gathering and reporting information in articles (which constitute "indexed information") that are primarily sourced through information available elsewhere on the Internet as evidenced by our reference links at the bottom of our articles.]  :(3) "in response to a user query"  [Users employ our own search function, i.e., user query, to find Wikipedia articles (or "indexed information")]  (Section (B) does not appear applicable to Wikipedia.)  This above parsing of the legislative language demonstrates at least the sloppiness in the legislative drafting, and, given the ambiguities such drafting give rise to, we can expect adverse rights owners to seek to take advantage.  If legislators wished to exclude Wikipedia-type sites, they could have done so using more specific language. They have not, and that worries me.  [[User:Geoffbrigham|Geoffbrigham]] ([[User talk:Geoffbrigham|talk]]) 00:18, 22 December 2011 (UTC) :<references />  :In response to some of the arguments (most of which I find quite fair in their presentation), allow me to quickly say the following (before I hop on a plane):    ::(1) The primary reason to oppose SOPA is its effect on the Internet and the precedent it creates for further censorship once the government gets comfortable with pulling down entire sites. That is, our focus should not necessarily be on only the definition of "internet search engine." Our site relies on other sites to provide us sources, so, in my opinion, an attack on those sites is indirectly an attack on us.   ::(2) As I said in my blog, one of the most serious issues with SOPA (Section 103) appears to be addressed from a Wikipedia viewpoint with the amendment introduced before the mark-up. The chances are now slim that any rights owner would argue we are an "Internet site dedicated to theft of U.S. property" under that provision.  ::(3) I understand conflicting views on the interpretation of "internet search engine," and, believe me, I will argue vigorously that the definition does not apply to us if we are challenged in court.  That said, I don't always trust prosecutors and judges - who sometimes look for ways to put round pegs into square holes without much technical expertise - to interpret the poorly-drafted definition of "internet search engine," especially when such proceedings are at the urging of well-financed and motivated rights owners.  In the end, we might be required to incur significant costs in courts to defend our position if the government does not exercise proper discretion.  A clean definition would prevent that.  In short, I'm concerned about the power and money of rights owners and how they may improperly affect government policy in this regard.   :Again many thanks to all for their different opinions.  I have tried to be balanced in my presentations and blog because I believe the community needs to understand the impact of SOPA without hyperbole, but obviously I welcome thoughtful disagreement which helps provide additional perspective.

It supports my guess that this is "the internet at large" being against copyright. That includes WP. WP - as a community, not every member - show little respect for copyright. I once uploaded a few photos, the copyright tags I placed on them were changed several times by some random users a couple times or so. WP also leaves up to community discussion several legal matters (like fair use for images) while we are no court at all. WP has no moral authority at all to protest. Joking a little, this is like a bank robber opposing a law against robbing banks. But all that is my opinion about copyright and its (poor) implementation at WP, subject for a nice calm, or heated, internal discussion.

This requires decisive action, and requires it urgently. It makes little sense for Wikipedia to refrain from action in order to uphold our apolitical ideals when so doing may well result in the elimination of the site itself. This is an extremely poorly-conceived and constructed piece of legislation, and it demands an unequivocal response. This is not a slippery slope. The Wikipedia community has historically shown great restraint against taking indiscriminate political action, and will continue to do so in the future, regardless of what decision is made here. The is no equivalency between an awareness-raising action regarding a bill that would necessitate universal censorship of Wikipedia and, say, the endorsement of a political candidate. To propose such is an insult to the intelligence and discretion of this community.  :Of the three SOPA-related action proposals thus far put forth, this is by far the best-articulated, and most immediately practicable one. It is respectful of the community, addresses all major the previously-raised objections, and is compatible with NPOV. It also—and I consider this crucial—includes a strong emphasis on creating high-value action on the part of the Wikipedia community and readership. The Tumblr auto-calling system mentioned in the proposal was a massive success, without which SOPA might have sailed through without the scrutiny that it is now receiving, and which it so needed. Without the tumblr action, our community might not even have the opportunity that we now have to draw further attention to this deeply-flawed legislation.[[User:AaronMuszalski|AaronMuszalski]] ([[User talk:AaronMuszalski|talk]]) 19:19, 19 December 2011 (UTC) <small>— [[User:AaronMuszalski|AaronMuszalski]] ([[User talk:AaronMuszalski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/AaronMuszalski|contribs]]) has made [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|few or no other edits]] outside this topic. </small> *'''Strong oppose'''.

When statements like this - including an appeal from 83 of the internet's founders about the dangers of SOPA - fall on deaf ears within Congress, it's time to act. Wikipedia has the power to reach thousands of people, and that kind of power should not be taken lightly or used carelessly. The situation is dire, but there may be hope if Wikipedia contributes to the awareness effort. As representative Zoe Lofgren pointed out, people have a tremendous power to influence legislation, as illustrated by the story of one of her colleagues rethinking his position on SOPA after a phone call from a small business owner in his district. If more representatives hear from their constituents about how counterproductive and dangerous this bill is, maybe the tide will turn. This is a crucial moment in the Internet's history, and I think that Wikipedia should take a stand, because SOPA undermines every value that this community is built on.

The proposal keeps changing, but some versions would not outlaw free content, but would change who decides if complaints are valid from a court, which is obliged to be fair and neutral, to the ISP of the person or organization who puts up the disputed content. Of course, the primary interest of the ISP is minimising the amount of staff time devoted to content issues, and the quickest way to resolve issues is to cancel the account of the accused subscriber.

I think the Wikipedia community is smart enough to figure out when we must speak out and when we should be silent.

The law requires Wikipedia to censor targeted sites, even when any allegation of infringement is clearly false. Even if a site actually contains nothing but Public Domain material. Even more significantly, I think it's wrong to say that Wikipedia itself actually is safe from being taken down or de-funded under this law. Wikipedia's supposed safety is conditional upon Wikipedia being confined within US borders. Imagine for a moment a law which explicitly prohibited Wikipedia from ever moving outside the US, prohibited us from ever utilizing any systems outside the US. Is there anyone here who would tolerate any such thing?

Seems like a no-brainer to me.

But another issue is, when should we take action that interrupts the average reader's experience on the encyclopedia?

I do not believe the threat SOPA poses is existential, remote, or minor.  I believe that, like democracy itself, those who fail to take action at the top of the slippery slope will find it ever harder to stop once they are headed into the abyss.  This is not a question of crying wolf.  WMF is obligated to take action to protect itself in the face of threats to its mission, much less existence.  The community must likewise take action to inspire a political response to defeat SOPA and PIPA. I don't see room for waffling. I see the need for courage and leadership from one of the great websites in the world.  Ronald Reagan is quoted often for saying "extremism in defense of liberty is no vice." Folks, liberty is precious. Ask those who are without it. Allowing this kind of constriction around the throat of liberty is intolerable in my view.  I support strong, direct action calculated towards education and intended to inspire everyone who is affected by the blackout to act politically to change the direction of the legislation.  It must be killed.  Geoff has done a fine job in parsing the language from a legal perspective, and I doff my cap for his efforts.  At an event for lawyers this evening, I was astonished at how few relatively informed people I know had even heard of SOPA, much less considered it on the merits, much less been inspired to take any action about it.  I utterly disagree with those who trivialize this legislation or the need for a response.  I also believe categorically that the situations where such action is necessary will likely be infrequent.  But a challenge to Section 230 of the CDA, or legislative attempts to restrict the internet in the name of bogus IP concerns, or technical threats to WMF's independence on the web?  No way.

If you don't know what that is, we review account requests from blocked users or users who can't create the account themselves for whatever reason. I'm going to get straight to the point, sometimes we get requests like "JimBob77" and there is an existing account named "JimBob76". We think it might be the same guy, and it probably is, but we're a little blind as we have no way to confirm it is in fact JimBob76 for password reset closes. I'd like to propose a feature where we can crosscheck the e-mail that the user submitted in the ACC request to the e-mail registered in the database for JimBob76. In order to comply with the privacy policy, we're only requesting that it returns "E-mail match" or "E-mail does not match". Ideally, these are the two options that could work.  1. Make a special page only available to accountcreators where you can insert the e-mail of the request and it'll return whether it matches or not. This will be logged.  2. Make a page where the ACC tool can automatically submit an e-mail check request if there is a similar account (automatically determined by the tool), and returns whether it matches or not. This shouldn't have to be logged, as a log will probably be available for an extended period of time in the ACC tool.

People in this community fall into three classes: non-admin users who do not have the accountcreator flag, non-admin users who ''do'' have the accountcreator flag, and admins (who don't need the accountcreator flag because the are admins). In addition, there's checkusers, but let's just forget about them for a minute. As currently proposed, this would be something that would be useful for people active in the ACC process in all three classes of users just outlined. *# If this were successful, which users would be affected? Those active in ACC? That would require a separate flag (ACC email check or something). If you go for accountcreators and admins, you have the issue of restricting it simply to admins who are active in ACC. Do we want to do that? I mean, it's procedurally easy enough for admins to apply to have ACC tool access an they'd probably get it, so they'd get access to this tool. *# What's to stop a malicious admins (and/or accountcreators) from using this to link existing Wikipedia accounts to email addresses of users without their consent? Someone pisses you off on Foundation-L, and they have some plausible deniability thing going on between their Wikipedia identity and the email address they contribute to Wikimedia mailing lists to. Or you just want to out someone. This is a powder keg waiting to explode. This is basically giving "CheckUser-lite" in the hands of people who haven't identified to the Wikimedia Foundation (i.e. admins or even accountcreators).

I'm not sure if there are any non-ACC accountcreators, but if so, that'll be an issue we could easily fix. This won't be given to the admin rights, no. We could just give the users who are active and trusted in ACC the accountcreator right, and that'll be closed. Again, we could perhaps somehow set it up that it would only accept a e-mail request from ACC, but only if the request handler opts into that. This will be logged of course, in the extremely rare case of abuse (we keep our ducks in line at ACC). I don't know of anybody at ACC who would abuse this tool. I think you misunderstood a little bit - it's not comparing the e-mail to all the other users, but rather to the similar user of the request you are handling.

Additionally, the argument for doing this seems weak: far better to enter discourse with "JimBob77" to establish whether he was indeed "JimBob76" (if for whatever reason you need to establish that...), rather than violating users' privacy for such a minor issue.

If there's no prior discussion, [[WP:BRD]] suggests that moving the page back and initiating a discussion is the right approach, but when I did that at [[Campaign for "santorum" neologism‎]] it was promptly moved again, then moved back, and then move-protected because of the move edit war.  I would prefer it if there were a policy-based argument that said something like: "if a move is made and is regarded as controversial, it should be reversed and a discussion opened at [[WP:RM]], and should not be moved again without consensus".  Ideally this should also allow a request for move protection to be made, with the caveat that the protecting admin should always move it back to the original version.  I'm aware of the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version wrong version] arguments, and generally agree with them, but I think there's a case to be made for treating the name a little more conservatively.  The problem with the current approach is that [[WP:RM]] does not agree to a move unless there is a clear consensus to the move, so a controversial move can be done successfully if the move is made and then taken to [[WP:RM]].  This is an incentive to bypass discussion, so I think our approach needs to be changed. [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] ([[User_talk:Mike Christie|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Mike_Christie|contribs]] -  [[User:Mike Christie/Reference library|library]]) 16:29, 8 January 2012 (UTC) :What should happen if the bold move isn't noticed for a long time?  This actually happened to [[yoghurt]], and they've been arguing over the "h" ever since.  [[WP:ENGVAR]] says to go to the "original" version.  Some people say that it started without the h, so it should be moved back.  Others argue that it's had the h for longer and is now "established" at the new title.  Title disputes are messy; the wrong version helps quell the edit war as fast as possible, without having to figure out what to do in some bizarre corner-case like yoghurt.  I do agree that someone pushing something through by being the more obnoxious party to the dispute is distasteful, but I just don't think there's any general way to solve that problem.  --'''''<font color="red">[[User:NYKevin|N]]</font><font color="green">[[User talk:NYKevin|Y]]</font><font color="blue">[[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|Kevin]]</font>''''' @370, i.e. 07:52, 10 January 2012 (UTC) ::I agree that long delays are problematic, but would it actually be helpful in a case like that if the policy were clear -- it should go back to the original version until there is consensus?

Therefore, if the closer feels that no consensus has been reached, they may move the article back to the most recent stable name. If the most recent stable name is itself a matter of dispute, closers are expected to use their own judgment in determining the proper destination."--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 11:26, 10 January 2012 (UTC) ::::I hadn't realized that; that's pretty much what I was looking for.

[[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] ([[User_talk:Mike Christie|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Mike_Christie|contribs]] -  [[User:Mike Christie/Reference library|library]]) 12:25, 10 January 2012 (UTC) :::::When I added in the language (in slightly different form) at the instruction guideline I remember there had been a few discussions at [[WT:RM]] about these types of moves being a problem, even with users doing the move and then a second edit to the redirect to make sure that only an admin had the ability to make the move back. You might want to trawl the archives a bit to see the various dicussions and bring up proposed changes there.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 13:39, 10 January 2012 (UTC)  :Two points: :* BRD doesn't suggest moving the page back as any sort of necessary or even desirable action.  "The talk page is open to all editors, not just bold ones. The first person to start a discussion is the person who is best following BRD."  The "R" step is strictly optional, and it's kinder to the database to skip it, especially if there's a chance that the new name will be adopted.  You don't need to reverse a page move to be able to discuss it at RM. :* ENGVAR is irrelevant; you should be following the actual policy on this point, which is at [[WP:TITLECHANGES]].  Although it generally takes a very conservative approach, it does not authorize reverting page moves during discussions.  Neither the article titles policy nor RM actually endorse the sort of "first-mover advantage" that you are worrying about.  The folks at RM are actually smart enough to figure out whether the current name is the name described as the no-consensus default at AT.

It’s not right that an editor or editors should have to go through a formal RM procedure to revert a unilateral bold move, and this can happen if technical difficulties prevent a revert without admin support (e.g. at [[Talk:Shishapangma/Archive_1#Requested_move|Shishapangma]]) or if the bold mover repeatedly moves without discussing.  The burden should be on the mover.  Also, a bold move can be followed by a filibuster to prevent the page being moved back.  Having a policy or guideline that says contested moves should be reverted, then discussed, would help ensure that the editor in favor of the move provides convincing reasons for the move.  Perhaps it could be implemented by adding a statement in the [[Wikipedia:Moving a page]] instructions along the lines of “If an editor questions a move, the page should be moved back to its previous title and the merits of the possible titles should be discussed.”--[[User:Wikimedes|Wikimedes]] ([[User talk:Wikimedes|talk]]) 21:23, 17 January 2012 (UTC)  I do also support the general principle that bold moves (controversial or potentially controversial page move performed without prior discussion) should not end up as de facto successful. I fully agree with [[User:Wikimedes|Wikimedes]] that the burden should be on the mover; the example at [[Talk:Shishapangma/Archive_1#Requested_move|Shishapangma]] shows that it is very time-consuming to move back a title, even with a large consensus in favor. Such time-consuming discussions are also discouraging good-faith editors to move back other boldly moved pages. I don't think that the time between the bold move and the revert is so relevant, as some moves for little visited articles can remain unnoticed during months (or even years).--[[User:Pseudois|Pseudois]] ([[User talk:Pseudois|talk]]) 07:43, 26 January 2012 (UTC)  == News that Wikipedia will be closed on January 18 2012 ==  I heard on [[Radio Four]] today (January 17 2012) that Wikipedia will be closed for one day on Jan 18 2012.

It's a global project.

A common experience when looking up a topic in Wikipedia is the feeling that one has learned something but not found all the information one would have wanted on a particular topic. Often, this is largely because the editors of that page have come at the topic from a particular angle (no criticism, that's just how humans work!). If only the editors of that topic knew what it was I (and other users, obviously) needed to know, they could soon update the content to reflect the broader viewpoint required for that topic.  Why not have, at the bottom of every article, an area where users can a) add questions they'd like to see answered in the text of that article, and b) see questions other users have already posed? Each time an edit is made that answers one of the questions in this list, that question could be removed from the list by admin. Admin could also remove questions that are not pertinent to or appropriate for that article.  Perhaps there are technical issues about adding user-modifiable text to the displayed webpage?

And like Dmcq said, mobile phone can apply " lesser word scheme " quite well, but the reason is not quite related the download limitation,i think, it's the phone screen's limitation, it's not that user friendly to read and move around such a big picture in a such a small screen (compared to desktop computer)all in all, sorting by words categories seems a bit far from my original purpose - essence your information. i don't know, i need to think more of that.--[[Special:Contributions/42.2.43.151|42.2.43.151]] ([[User talk:42.2.43.151|talk]]) 01:18, 22 January 2012 (UTC)  ::The theory of relativity is mentioned in the very first sentence.

Also you can normally adjust the format of pages for mobiles so the text just goes down the screen instead of needing to pan over a large screen, there will be some option of the browser to do that and Wikipedia behaves quite well in Opera mobile for instance. There's still room for improvement but it's mainly problems in the content because of the editor generated content rather than the site itself, probably there should be a bit of a drive to deal with such things, also some extra work could be done to make tables behave better.

[[User:ACEOREVIVED|ACEOREVIVED]] ([[User talk:ACEOREVIVED|talk]]) 09:11, 27 January 2012 (UTC)  == Automatic warning when creating section heading exactly matching an existing section heading ==  When creating a section heading, I feel it would be beneficial if the parser would direct us to a "''are you sure?''" page that we must ''agree'' to before continuing the save. Since the table of contents and section links are basically useless when on whatever page there are more than one section with the same heading, this might help to stop some of the doppelgängers ever happening and thus make navigation simpler.  Further to this, it might be even nicerer to have automatic anchoring, for any precisely similar section headings that are created even after the warning/alert (alert is perhaps a better word).  I realise that {{tl|anchor}}s exist to solve parts of this issue, but they must be added by hand and known of by any editor who wishes to take advantage of them. To know where all the anchors are would be a logistical nightmare (''what links here?'', have fun with that). For ease and common simplicity, surely the parser should take care of all this stuff for us.  So I propose that: *On saving a page we are alerted to the fact we are creating a section heading exactly matching an existing section heading. *We must either change the section name or agree to go ahead anyway, before the page can be saved. *Preferably, if any page has any exactly matching section headings, the parser (whenever it spots them (every page edit)) automatically adds an anchor to the sections in question that should be labelled simply as perhaps ''Example heading 1'', ''Example heading 2'' etc., so that we (editors) know where to find them, that they are certainly there, and what they'll be called.  I expect there are many technical issues and editorial considerations here, but Rome wasn't built in a day (gotta start somewhere).&nbsp;[[User:Fred_Gandt|'''<span style="font-family:arial;color:#055;font-size:16px;">f<i style="color:#0dd;font-size:10px;">red</i>g<i style="color:#0dd;font-size:10px;">andt</i></span>''']] 22:10, 22 January 2012 (UTC) <!-- end of proposal --> :You've fallen into this trap before I think: when you start a new section (using the "+" link) you get a URL with "&section=new". This lets the parser handle just the new section text when you preview.

You type a nice reply to the most recent kitten-sender, hit the save button, and your page displays the first kittie-message on reloading, not the one you've just replied to! @Franamax: I'm sure there must be a way of achieving this without the parser having to parse the entire page, it just may not be immediately apparent.

Potentially faster (not that either would be slow) and cleaner (no http requests for a copy of the page in order to check it), but would require almost an entire new extension to be built. One practical upshot of the DB method would be having the DB of section headings for every page (constantly updated (every page edit)) to be used in whatever other way could be imagined.

Jimbo recently talked to [[Bell Pottinger]] (described [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&oldid=471888178#My_morning_at_Bell_Pottinger here]). It's a complicated and contentious issue, and if I'm understanding the debate correctly, [[Public relations|PR]] firms are offering the following types of cases where their intervention is needed or useful: *There's derogatory and false (or at any rate unsourced) information about their client in their article. Their client doesn't know how to engage Wikipedia effectively (e.g. OTRS, edit within our rules, etc.) and so they need professionals to fix this. *There may not exactly be ''false'' information, but the article is slanted and looks rather like a hatchet job. Our client simply wants a neutral and fair article (which is what Wikipedians should want also). Again, a professional is best suited to fixing this. *And some clients would like to have a Wikipedia article, and we believe that they are sufficiently notable, but there's no article; and they don't want to wait years (or forever) for some random person to create the article. And since they are sufficiently notable (we believe) then an article would enhance the Wikipedia, which should meet the desires both of our client and Wikipedians generally. It'd be silly to take this entirely at face value (because for one thing "neutral and fair" depends on your point of view, and it's only human for one's point of view may be influenced by who is cutting one's paycheck). BUT, these are valid concerns and, when they do occur, serious problems (the first two anyway). Because they are valid concerns and serious problems, these are good reasons (or excuses if you prefer) for PR firms and paid agents to claim a moral right to edit the Wikipedia and a practical need to do so.  For my part, I'm against paid agents being allowed to edit the Wikipedia. (There is the question of whether as ''practical'' matter it's better, tactically, to allow this as opposed to driving it all underground; that's a different issue and outside the scope of this thread.) So, is there another way, rather than allowing or welcoming paid agents, to address these concerns?  Yes, possibly, and I have some concrete suggestions. This is not going to happen right away but it's something worth talking about, maybe. What I'm proposing is: *As the main proposal, creation of an "Articles about Extant Corporations" policy similar to [[WP:BLP|Biographies of living persons (BLP)]]. *As a secondary proposal, perhaps looser notability requirements for [[WP:CORP]]. *As a secondary proposal, the deployment of a template which is essentially the converse of {{tl|advert}}. Details below.  ===Articles about Extant Corporations [[WP:AEC]]=== '''Articles about Extant Corporations'''. (This would include non-profit organizations and almost all businesses, even single stores and restaurants, since those are almost always incorporated. But some or many single-person businesses aren't incorporated. It could be "Articles about Extant Organizations" instead, which would be similar but not embracing exactly the same sets.)  Various details to be worked out but the basic thrust would be similar to [[WP:BLP]]. Corporations aren't ''exactly'' like people so there'd have to be some changes from [[WP:BLP]], but it could be expressed with a similar summary: {{policy in a nutshell|Material about extant corporations added to ''any'' Wikipedia page must be written with the greatest care and attention to [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability]], [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutrality]], and [[Wikipedia:No original research|avoiding original research]].}} {{notice|'''If you are concerned about the accuracy or appropriateness of material about an extant corporation on Wikipedia''', report problems at the [[Wikipedia:Biographies of extant corporations/Noticeboard|biographies of extant corporations noticeboard]]. For articles about your (or your client's) corporation, please see "[[#Dealing with articles about your corporation|Dealing with articles about your corporations]]" below.}}  With a corresponding tag for article talk pages: {{tmbox | small = {{{small|}}} | type  = content | style = background:#fffaef; border: 1px solid #c0c090; | class = wpb-outside<!--don't display inside banner shells--> | image = none | text  = This article must adhere to the policy on '''[[Wikipedia:Articles about extant corporations|articles about extant corporations]]''', even if it is not about a specific corporation, because it contains material about extant corporations. Contentious material about extant corporations that is unsourced or [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|poorly sourced]] '''must be removed immediately''' from the article and its talk page, especially if potentially [[Wikipedia:Libel|libellous]] or deprecatory. If such material is repeatedly inserted, or if there are other concerns about edits related to an extant corporation, please report the issue to the [[Wikipedia:Articles about extant corporations/Noticeboard|articles about extant corporations noticeboard]].

The Foundation would possibly (maybe) take a hand in promoting and perhaps even monitoring this effort if it gains any traction.  ===Reform of [[WP:CORP]]=== While this remains on the table, it's secondary and peripheral, and is a distraction from the main point, so I'm making it less visible. Discussion remains open though. [[User:Herostratus|Herostratus]] ([[User talk:Herostratus|talk]]) 15:42, 21 January 2012 (UTC) {{hidden begin |title = Loosening notability requirements |titlestyle = background:#CEE6F2; }} [[WP:CORP]] could be made less stringent. Perhaps something along the lines of requiring just one reliable independent ref, and the requirement only proving that the entity exists, and maybe that other material from the article could come from non-independent sources -- the company's web site, for instance. Or something like that.  This would be helpful to corporations, especially corporations whose Google profile is not so good, since the Wikipedia article would likely rise to the top or near and per [[WP:AEC]] it would probably be reasonably positive, usually.   Since proof of existence is a simple bright-line test, this would also obviate a lot of contentious discussions about whether a particular entity is or is not notable, which discussions probably sometimes draw in in covert or overt paid agents, which is what we're trying to avoid.  Granted "being helpful to corporations" isn't really part of our core mission, but remember the point here is to get the PR industry off our case and out of our Wikipedia, and this helps this by removing both a philosophical argument for their involvement and a practical reason for same, to some extent. {{hidden end}}  ==={{tl|Hatchetjob}}=== While this remains on the table, it's secondary and peripheral, and is a distraction from the main point, so I'm making it less visible.

But I'm a social democrat and while I appreciate the cool things that corporations make and do, for-profit corporations are amoral entities and their social impact is mixed and they need plenty of oversight. That's my opinion, and a more pro-business person might feel that these are good proposals on the merits. It comes down to a philosophical opinion on what an article about a corporate entity should ''be'': more of a listing of their vital statistics and description of their products and so forth, or more a description of their role in society, or whatever. We're not ''Frontline'' but we're not the Chamber of Commerce either, and threading that needle is difficult and contentious.  However, I'm not not suggesting this on the merits, but as I said for two reasons: *To address the concerns (or professed concerns if you prefer) of the PR industry. *To remove some of the practical reasons for the PR industry to be involved with the Wikipedia. If this proposal doesn't gain traction, it doesn't mean that these concerns won't be addressed. It just means that they'll be addressed by agents of the corporations themselves, directly. This is problematic as it threatens our reputation, the morale of the volunteers, and our actual neutrality, in my opinion.   There's no force on earth that will stop paid agents from editing the Wikipedia, of course. The point is to strip it of its raison d'etre and reduce the need for it.

And this was there for quite a while. And nobody noticed it, or cared. But the corporation noticed it. And ''they'' cared. But they couldn't change it (because they don't know how to edit or engage with the Wikipedia properly). So they hired paid agents. I don't like paid agents roaming the database. But if the alternative is that entities will be described as "wanting to kill you" (if it's not justified; it might be in [[al-Qaeda|some cases]]), then bring them on.

Well, first off, corporations don't ''care''; despite bizarre court rulings suggesting otherwise, corporations are not human or mammalian or even alive, so they're incapable of caring or indeed of having feelings of any kind. As for the ''people'' affiliated with the corporation who cared—well, I'm finding it a little hard to imagine that they were capable of using a web browser to find their corporation's article yet were utterly stymied by the links reading "edit this page", "discussion", and "Contact Wikipedia" that appeared above and alongside that article.

There's no compelling reason for us to institute a corporate equivalent of our BLP policy, and '''''every''''' reason to be on guard for their attempts to warp our [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] articles to their liking with paid editing.

I think a noticeboard and a couple of templates would be very helpful but am wary of making this a bigger thing with substantial policy changes, like BLP.

This will allow us to determine if: #pending changes affects the numbers of IPs editing  #to what degree pending changes reduces the visibility of poor quality content.  The proposed student will be either between first and second year or second and third year medicine and will be working 40 hours per week for 6-8 weeks during the summer.

On the one hand, their articles have a higher quality of writing--on he other, they are by our standards very often inadequately documented.

During the trial, the difficulties were such that I at least simply refrained from editing any article under the trial despite my admin status which meant anything I edited would be automatically approved by the system.  (The effect of the deWP system is such that I no longer attempt to do even simple error-fixing there--which I must admit is all I'm generally capable of in that language. --that's part of the basis on which i anticipate a similar discouraging effect here.)  I think the best way of distracting us from positive work on the problems of Wikipedia would be to reintroduce the subject. I'm glad the programmers made the final decision--their disgust at working so hard on what was not implemented led them to refuse to work further unless we would commit, and since we would not commit without proof that it worked better, this put an end to it.

Since May, I have been rather active in attempts to reform the dispute resolution processes. Back in June, I [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 74#Dispute resolution noticeboard|proposed]] the creation of the [[WP:DRN|dispute resolution noticeboard]], which has been reasonably successful in its aims to provide an open style of addressing content disputes.  Since then, I have been working on a few other ideas. While I want to come up with a way to tackle POV pushing, my current proposal is [[Wikipedia:Binding RFCs]], a method for resolving intractable content disputes. The proposal explains how the process would work, but in essence, it's a two part discussion which would be closed by three users, an admin, a user experienced in the subject area, and a user experienced in dispute resolution. I envision the discussion structure would somewhat resemble the recent [[Wikipedia_talk:Verifiability/Archive_53#RFC_-_Compromise_proposal_re_first_sentence|RFC on the verifiability]] policy, but with some changes, part one of the discussion would only be to present evidence in favour of X proposal or Y proposal (policies, reliable sources, past precedent etc) and the second part being an AfD styled discussion, with comments weighed depending on strength of argument.  I'm happy to answer any questions relating to my proposal and clarify any details. I feel the proposal page itself explains how the process would work, thus I have not rehashed it here. I think that this differs as opposed to other binding content proposals because it puts the power to resolve these issues in the hands of the community.

I've seen too much of the drama board lynch mob mentality around here. Ultimately this should be the function of our elected representatives, ArbCom. That they seem to have no taste for "resolving content disputes" (even though they, in practice, do exactly that) is part of their own group failing, in my view. They need to work faster, to seek less massive and often irrelevant testimony, and to be more aggressive topic-banning POV warriors off their treasured battlegrounds.

People often ignore consensus, because it's not the consensus that they want, and often things like topic bans do not work. The dispute over the images at Muhammad is a good example of this. The other problem with continued discussion is that if one RFC closes with X result, some users will not be happy with the result, even if there was a clear consensus, and they may open another RFC(s) until they get the result they want. This often causes disruption to the wiki, and drives editors away, and this is what the process I am proposing is designed to tackle. <font face="Verdana">[[User:Steven Zhang|<font color="#078330">Steven</font>]] [[User talk:Steven Zhang|<font color="#2875b0">Zhang</font>]] <sup>[[WP:DRP|<font color="#d67f0f">Join the DR army!</font>]]</sup></font> 21:34, 2 January 2012 (UTC) **RFCs are not binding, and they are occasionally ignored, but the usual method of "ignoring" is to claim that you're asking a new question.  And sometimes you actually ''are'' asking a new question, so we can't just ban that.  To give an example of a complicated situation:  There was an RFC a while ago about whether to have an [[art nude]] be the first picture at [[Pregnancy]].  Most editors said no.  They gave two basic classes of reasons, one of which boiled down to editorial judgment (what they thought best for the article), and the other of which was a fairly technical issue about whether the nude woman had consented to have her picture spread around the internet in the first place.  So it closed as "no nude in the lead—unless there really was valid consent for posting the nude photograph to Commons, in which case who knows ("no consensus"), because we honestly have no idea what all of the editors worried about consent would think if the consent were correctly verified". </br>Well, the consent issue was (finally) resolved (apparently at the cost of greatly irritating the photographer).  The pro-nude group said that the now-lack of consensus meant that the article was required to have an artsy nude in the lead.  The other editors opened a new RFC, to deal with the "new" question, which was "Now that nobody has to worry about that tricky consent issue, what do you want to do in this article?"  That is, IMO, a valid "new" question, but the losing side (the pro-nude group knew they were going to lose, and in fact it was ultimately about 70% against using the nude in the lead) spent weeks complaining that this was "ignoring" an RFC that should have been binding. </br>The thing is that most disputes aren't binary.  It's not a question of "yes" or "no".  To use this same example, the "simple" question was really multiple questions:  "Shall we have any image in the lead?  If so, what image (from among hundreds already available to us) shall we put there?  Shall we use this art nude in this article at all?  If so, shall we use it in the lead or in another section?  What caption shall we give the art nude, if we use it?"  It's hard to envision a binding decision on such a discussion that we'd really want to make binding.  "Let's stop arguing over having a nude in the lead" would be helpful (having that nude in the lead had generated persistent complaints since it was first added), but "We decided on the woman in the blue shirt" isn't necessarily something that anyone would want to consider binding.

For example, if a binding RFC makes it evident that X content should be removed because it violates Y policy, such as BLP, and a user reinserts this anyways, then they would be warned and directed to the discussion that took place, with other actions such as page bans would need to be considered.

Despite that, however, I would be ''very'' cautious about bringing binding RFCs into the fold of every-day dispute resolution mechanisms.  There seems to be a sense here that a proposal like this is an obviously good idea. I would absolutely disagree that. Binding RFCs can lead to deep rifts in editors (as it did on Wikiproject Ireland) and do not lead the the "right" answer (the dispute they resolve are those where there is no "right" answer). This is because they run contrary to normal collaborative and consensus-based practice on Wikipedia and, by their very nature, they strip whole swathes of ([[WP:AGF|constructive and well-intentioned]]) editors of their voice either indefinitely or for a set amount of time.  Because of this, anything like a binding RFC is rarely, if ever, a good idea and, therefore, having an explicit process for them would be a bad idea IMO. In practice, if binding RFCs were commonplace, I believe they would quickly fall into something akin to what I call the "tyranny of consensus": decisions where [[WP:CCC|consensus is not allowed to change]] because, we are told, the existing arrangement ''is'' consensus and attempts to change it are, therefore, disruptive. Situations like that are incredibly vexatious and <u>not</u> a good idea, either for dispute resolution or content development. Certainly, I do not believe that commonplace binding RFCs would promote either harmonious relationships or good solutions to difficult questions.  Despite this, I would suggest that there is no need for a proposal of this sort: the means for binding RFCs already exist — and bindings RFCs do have a place  — but their place is under [[WP:IAR]]. Under [[WP:IAR]], the existing precedents for binding RFCs already allow for binding solutions to inextricable disputes. However, under the existing arrangement they are entered into only when all other means are exhausted and where participants to the dispute agree mutually that a binding RFC, outside of the normal "rules" of Wikipedia, is the best, probably only, way forward. That is what gives the existing examples of bindings RFCs the strength of legitimacy they need.  Further, I don't believe it is wise that a proposal for a process that diverges so greatly from [[WP:CON|core wikipedia policy]] and current practice should come from the ether. The best policies and guidelines come from already existing practice. They begin as consensus already and are simply formalised into policy. Therefore, I don't think that a proposal like this is a wise idea. An essay or guideline that drew on the lessons of the examples of binding RFCs that we already have may be a good idea. But coming up with a brand new process for something like this, without basing that process on the learning we already have, would, in my opinion, be a bad idea.  Finally, from my experience on the Ireland example, I would say that the following would are important points to consider for any binding RFC:  * '''Consensus for a binding resolution:''' The impetus for a binding resolution <u>must</u> come from the participants in the dispute and be agreed in consensus by them. Otherwise, there will be an enormous sense of aggrievement and a feeling that outsider are enforcing resolution to a dispute that they do not understand. This view would not only be serious, and may be long-lasting, but it would in many case be quite justified. * '''Exhaustion of other means:''' This impetus should be driven by the absolute exhaustion of other modes for resolution. A binding resolution should only be adopted in the most extreme of cases, where discussion and dispute resolution has been on-going for years. It should never be entered into lightly or for the sake of convenience. In all, the decision to arrive at an binding resolution should come the absolute exasperation of all sides. * '''[[WP:CCC|Consensus can change]]:''' Time limits on how "binding" the outcomes are are probably best. I suggest 12, 18, or 24 months are appropriate terms. Any longer would be normally excessive IMO. In the Ireland-name case, two years was long enough for views to settle to a reasonable level. * '''Clear, objective and mutually verifiable outcome:''' A vote is more likely to be suitable than a discussion. If the dispute was resolvable by discussion then it would not need a "binding" solution. A clear, single and objectively measurable outcome is necessary. Otherwise, the decision will be disputed. In the Ireland case, we used the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternate-vote system]]. This allowed multiple options to be voted on in terms of preference. * '''A mutually-agreed process in advance:''' A boiler plate process may not be suitable for all disputes. Different disputes have different components and no two disputes are the same. Additionally, the need for consensus among the participants to a dispute for a binding RFC, and for the consensus of participants to recognise the outcome of the RFC, mean the participants in the dispute will need to be involved in shaping the process through which the binding resolution will be arrived at. That means that no two binding RFCs will likely be identical. However, they may share common features. * '''Recognition that the outcome is not the "answer":''' There needs to be recognition that the outcome is not consensus — or the "correct" answer — but rather it is a "best we can do" to resolve a long-runing dispute <u>for the time being</u>. There is no benefit in running roughshod over genuine and informed views of well-intentioned editors just because they happen to be on the wrong side of the views of others (often the views of people who know less about the subject than they do). * '''Agreed "facts" and a voice for opposing views:''' Clear, understandable and mutually-agreed background info needs to be provided to outsiders in advance of inviting them to participate in the RFC. Additionally, individual participants need to be able to express their own voice. In the Ireland case, individual participants in the dispute were also able to provide their own statements on a subpage and these were able to be endorsed by other participants in the dispute ahead of the vote being opened to "outsiders". This allowed for both a commonly agreed backgrounder as well as enabling individual editors to set out their own stalls. * '''A legitimate authority:''' There is a suggestion that a process for a binding RFC could by-pass ArbCom. I would completely disagree. There needs to be an authority to back up the decision. That authority needs legitimacy and absolute authority to enforce what will. in effect, be an arbitrary decision. The only body that can effectively and legitimately do that in all circumstances is,  IMO, ArbCom. Regardless of whether ArbCom are involved or not, without an strong legitimate authority to enforce the decision, the decision won't be accepted by a consensus of editors into the future and will eventually come apart or turn into farce.  --[[User:Rannpháirtí anaithnid|<span style="color:black;">RA</span>]] ([[User talk:Rannpháirtí anaithnid|talk]]) 22:49, 15 January 2012 (UTC) :Haven't read your entire comments, but I would see this as a process that is not commonly used.

Rather than coming up with something new out of the ether, you should look at how binding RFCs work right now. The oldest example, I think, is [[Talk:Gdansk/Vote|Gdansk]].

See my userboxes for more info: {{User:Timeshifter/Userboxes/Unresolved content disputes}} {{User:Timeshifter/Userboxes/Lack of arbitrators}}  {{clear left}} This idea for binding content discussions is one proposal of various content dispute arbitration methods. It should be used only after other simpler feedback from admins and arbitrators. Right now admins and arbitrators don't officially comment on content. They should be summoned right away. And they should comment directly on the article talk page. See: [[User:Timeshifter/Unresolved content disputes]]. Editors are leaving because of this. --[[User:Timeshifter|'''Timeshifter''']] ([[User talk:Timeshifter|talk]]) 11:11, 16 January 2012 (UTC) :Yah, this is kind of the crux. Content discussions '''are''' binding (or should be), in the sense that you shouldn't be editing against the consensus as revealed in those discussions. And if it's not clear what consensus has been revealed in those discussions, then you need an admin to come and sort it out, say what the result it, and make sure it's enforced. Unfortunately, admins are fairly unwilling to do this in the case of ordinary (non-process) page-content discussions, I think because of two strands of muddled thinking: (1) ''"The fact that there's still disagreement show's that there can't be consensus."'' Nonsense, of course, since our definition of consensus does not require unanimity; and this is clearly seen when admins close the process discussions (Afd, RM, ...) (2) ''"Admins are not supposed to decide content disputes."'' Well they're not supposed to impose their own opinions on content; but that's no reason why they shouldn't assess the result of content-related discussions - as of course they do every day at xfD and RM, which are also content discussions, just a particular type thereof.--[[User:Kotniski|Kotniski]] ([[User talk:Kotniski|talk]]) 12:10, 16 January 2012 (UTC) :'''...but....''' the way discussions are closed at the moment is unsatisfactory, particularly for debates about article wording, where multiple possibilities exist. I mean, it works all right for most simple everyday RMs etc., but not for long, complex or fraught debates. Here we need the admin to act not as a one-person jury ("I've looked at the discussion and have decided this"), but someone who can possibly mediate a bit so as to focus the discussion, possibly suggest compromise solutions, or in any case talk to the participants a bit just to be sure he's noted and understood all the arguments and counterarguments correctly.

And they should not have that authority except as part of a process we set up for settling content disputes. But their opinions and experience are valuable, and admins should be summoned much sooner concerning content disputes. And it should be quick, and above all, done on the article talk page. Oftentimes editors don't understand that [[WP:NPOV]] is not necessarily implemented by picking one description of the facts, but by pointing out all significant viewpoints. Admins can explain this quickly, and editors are less likely to believe it is wikilawyering since the admin is new to the discussion. --[[User:Timeshifter|'''Timeshifter''']] ([[User talk:Timeshifter|talk]]) 13:21, 16 January 2012 (UTC) :::I believe admins ''do'' have the authority to decide content disputes (as they do regularly at AfD and RM, which are particular types of content dispute; as well as at RfCs, sometimes, when asked). We don't need to set up a new process; we just have to get people into the habit of asking admins to help reach a settlement when the editors themselves can't work out what they've decided (of course, in most cases this won't be necessary), and admins into the habit of responding positively to such requests, and everyone out of the mindset that "closing" a discussion must be a single God-like act without any interaction with the participants. So what I'm suggesting is fairly similar to what you're suggesting - summon an admin for help in resolving the dispute, but the reason it's useful for it to be an ''admin'' rather than any other experienced editor is that admins have the authority (and should be given more of it) to take firm action against those who continue to disrupt the process or edit against consensus.--[[User:Kotniski|Kotniski]] ([[User talk:Kotniski|talk]]) 17:53, 16 January 2012 (UTC) ::::Admins should absolutely not be given that authority. It goes against a core belief in Wikipedia that goes all the way back to the dispute between Jimbo Wales and Larry Sanger concerning "experts." AfDs and RMs are not content disputes. One is about deleting an article. One is about changing the name of articles. Neither decide the content of articles. [[WP:Edit warring]] is one of the most disruptive of the guidelines because admins are using it arbitrarily to decide content disputes. It should be used first as a warning by an admin, and not used first as a block.

RMs and AfDs are simply ''particular types of content dispute'' - in the first case about that part of the content of an article that goes above the top line, and in the second case about whether to include the whole content of a given article in the encyclopedia.

Admins assess consensus on many issues, such as XfD, RM etc. Bureaucrats assess RfAs. Non-admins can close some clear cut discussions as well. I decided on this approach because the ideas of content committees have been shot down in the past repeatedly, and this seems the best option to address intractable content disputes by the community. Set up a structured discussion with clear possible outcomes, users add material supporting X or Y, and members of the community opine on the discussions.

We start on the article page, and try to talk things out.  2. We invite uninvolved editors in in an RFC, 3. As a last resort, we ask Arb Com to talk it out. Arb Com doesn't rule on the page itself, but on user behavior.  In all of these cases, there is an attempt to reach a flexible consensus.  :Binding RFCs won't do that; you'll make winners and losers, you'd force people to take sides, you invite Wikilawyering, and unless but there's a very clear vote on wording, you're still going to have further arguments over the nature of the vote, only now with the winners being self-righteous and the losers pissed off. Further support or oppose vote cast by a drive-by-editor will have the same weight as the contributions of an editor who takes a great deal of time attempting to reach a compromise.

For example, if an argument was made for common name usage, a demonstration of how common it is, and so on. After this, editors would partake in an AFD style discussion, commenting on which they prefer and why based on the information presented, eg, "I prefer X as is the common name as demonstrated in Y sources" or something like that.   ::All in all, binding discussions of content should indeed be the exception to the norm, but part of the problem in the past has been a lack of a unified method to hold such a discussion.

Locking down content isn't a great idea, but it's better than endless heated discussions over X versus Y, which people end up leaving over. That's my opinion, and is the reason I made this proposal.

And there was no hope of consensus ever being reached. So, instead, in stark contrast to normal practice (see [[WP:IAR]]), we decided things by democracy (or at least we did in two cases).

In fact, the [[wiktionary:kibosh|kibosh]] was put on all further discussion of the matter. :::::The point that I am making is that processes of these kind fit under [[WP:IAR]] (as they are right now).

Crucially, this was one that was agreed in consensus by the community in dispute according to the needs of resolving their particular dispute. Bindings RFCs are right at the fringe of dispute resolution and therefore straight-racketing them according to one policy, devised out of the ether, is not a good idea. The process needs enormous consensus from the community in conflict (and so needs to come from them), otherwise the result will lack legitimacy. --[[User:Rannpháirtí anaithnid|<span style="color:black;">RA</span>]] ([[User talk:Rannpháirtí anaithnid|talk]]) 14:14, 17 January 2012 (UTC) ::::::You seem to be confusing consensus with unanimity  (as someone always does when these matters  are discussed).

If Arbitrators don't perform as expected, we don't vote for them next time around, if the closer of a binding RfC abuses the position, what's the mechanism for removing them from that position in the future?

They reach their decisions through a private gossipy mailing list, and are not interested in amending them (except through a long and tortuous process) when mistakes are pointed out. And you can't vote them out - you'll be outnumbered by those who just vote the established arbs back in every time (most voters won't have been paying much attention to the details of any decisions, any more than real-life voters pay attention to the details of the laws that their electees pass). So in practice, ArbCom is no more accountable - less, I would say - than admins (most of whom are at least prepared to talk to editors and explain and perhaps even modify their decisions). But in any case, given there isn't any perfect solution, and that ArbCom has limited capacity, and that two (or three) instances of wise but possibly fallacious judgment are better than one, it seems clear to me that it should go (1) admin decides; (2) possible appeal to other admins; (3) possible appeal to ArbCom.

In these discussions the consensus approach has a hard time yielding results. Heavily structuring these discussions might solve this by stronger involvement of neutral parties which guide the discussion. Furthermore, by ensuring all the elements are presented in a structured way this would prevent or at least hamper people repeatedly reintroducing arguments or performing other non-constructive discussions. However, I do not see why this should be in the form of lawyer-like 'binding RfC' system. If the consensus system has broken down because of user behavior, ArbCom should be sufficient. If the consensus system yields no results because of the many aspects of the discussion, heavily structuring the debate would suffice.  If the consensus system yields no result because of conflicting sources, a voting system or binding RfC proces should be avoided and a way should be found that addresses the multiple truths. This might be hard in the case of naming disputes, but I am confident that a structured debate would in the end yield acceptable results (see [[Talk:Republic_of_China]]).

But I think that it needs more discussion, in order to ensure that it addresses certain issues. Based on my own experience, I feel that existing dispute resolution discussions tend to be "free-for-alls", full of acusations and rhetoric. Here is what I believe needs to be addressed. #All statements must include diffs. In my case, a few editors noted that they were "having a hard time finding a single shred of evidence against" me. If I am a "POV-warrior", it will be trivial to include several diffs. Despite an editor requesting whether "anyone here provide a single diff", none were forthcoming. #Some editors noted there was no "due process". Such a process must be fair and timely. One of the reasons the nominator gave for discontinuing Community Bans, was that mine was an "amazing example .. five hours and eleven minutes [..] who finds that rather unfair"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Community_sanction_noticeboard_%28second_nomination%29#Wikipedia:Community_sanction_noticeboard]  #Due process must include consideration of points made.

There would be no room for wikilawyering, because users would only be able to present information on option W vs option X vs option Y etc, and then members of the community (as well as the parties) opine on the discussion. The notification of the discussion being in progress (say through a watchlist notice) will help offset this too, because uninvolved users could analyse the information supporting the alternative options and weigh in.

Which I did, creating [[Alabama State Monument (Gettysburg)]], [[North Carolina State Monument (Gettysburg)]], and [[Virginia State Monument (Gettysburg)]].

A very simple solution I've got for this would be some hidden categories that could be placed on articles or their talk pages to help identify articles by the language of their references. A hidden category for something like "Wikipedia articles with Russian sources" could then enable Wikipedians who speak Russian to locate articles easily.

Short titles) the intended use of which would be to confirm, amend or supplement existing data already present. The current legislation.gov.uk site does not meet the requirement as it only holds legislation still in force, and seemingly not information about historical repeals.  With this in mind it would be appreciated if you were able to respond to the following questions (under Freedom of Information provisons)  i) Does your orgainsation in fact retain a list of the titles (in specific Short Titles) and Chapter Numbers for all UK primary legislation? (In print this dataset would be the 'Chronological Table of The Statutes')  ii) If held, (or can be provided) what period (specifically which Monarchs) this dataset covers, and when it was last revised?  iii) If held,(or can be provided) the likely time-scale needed to provide this data in a 'machine-readable' format, licensed subject to Open Government License terms the intent being to confirm and supplement data already held within Wikipedia and Wikisource.  iv) If not held,  which organisation or official publication contains a partial version of the data being sought, and under what restrictions such data-set or publication can be provided?"

They need to be avoided before they are used in 10,000 more Wikipages.  The 3 or 4 of us working on that will probably never be able to deal with the huge number of pages that use them. A bot is being discussed. But in the meantime, how do we go about promoting the existence of these lists so that:  :* People know they exists and hence avoid these publishers, given that they often show up on Google books, and just get used :* People can look for the uses of these sources in the thousands of (or even more?) articles in which they are used, and somehow remedy the situation  Of course one way was to leave this message here, but other ideas (or actual help in cleaning up the use of these sources) will be appreciated.

Currently, all hatnotes are displayed at the top of each article. The worst example I know of is this one: [[Century]]: "Centuries", "Centenary", "Centennial", and "Centennials" redirect here. For other uses, see Centuries (disambiguation), Centenary (disambiguation), Centennial (disambiguation), and Centennials (disambiguation). For other uses, see Century (disambiguation)."  I'm sure there are other examples like that.  We can do better than that. What if the hatnotes were dynamic, and they only displayed themselves based on the redirect that the user came from. So, for example, if I came from (Centenary), I would only get the centenary redirect hatnote.  The user interface could be simple - basically, there would be a certain class of hatnote templates that is dynamic. In the template, you specify all of the redirects that you want the hatnote to be triggered by. The software would normalize, (so you don't have to specify "Centuries" and "centuries" etc) by decapitalizing, removing spaces, and converting accents to ascii for example - that way, if new redirects get added, they might still trigger the hatnote.--[[User:Karl.brown|KarlB]] ([[User talk:Karl.brown|talk]]) 02:57, 4 May 2012 (UTC)  :Oooh, great idea! --[[Special:Contributions/76.69.138.105|76.69.138.105]] ([[User talk:76.69.138.105|talk]]) 06:00, 6 May 2012 (UTC) : Yes, that would be great for redirects.

There have been several, piecemeal discussions in recent weeks about ITN, the general theme being whether it is too focussed on things which are general news, and not enough on stand-alone, consequential, encyclopaedic events. In my judgement, there is a significant strand of opinion that we should go all-out to move towards the latter, but at the same time there is a legitimate resistance to removing the only true avenue to the Main Page that "highly significant yet routine" news events have.   So I've been thinking about how we could possibly marry these two seemingly conflicting wishes. And I think a possible solution might be to use the TFL slot, which currently only runs on Mondays, to when appropriate feature "Today's topical article". This would be a reasonably well-developed article (C Class due to relatively minor deficiencies at an absolute minimum, ideally B class, GA or FA), on an article which under the current ITN system would ordinarily get a blurb. The existence of this section &ndash; which I envisage would only be used on 50-80% of the available days, due to the availability of stories and quality of articles &ndash; would enable us to steer ITN firmly in the direction of covering major, encyclopaedic events, rather than simply things which we consider important enough. I envisage that the overriding factor would simply be quality of article: where the supply of stories exceeds space it should simply be a race to the top, and a consensus decision on which is the higher quality article. If there is not an article which is at the very least close to B-class quality, we do not run an article at all on that day.   Thoughts? —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  15:11, 11 May 2012 (UTC)  Addendum: For clarity, I am not proposing that we replace TFL (I am after all one of its biggest proponents).

ITN would remain, albeit it would probably shift significantly towards "major recent events" (things outside of the usual news cycle), and away from "general news".<p>Essentially, the message to those who want to get something related to "general news" onto the Main Page would be to work on the article, and if it's of high enough quality, the article will be rewarded with high-quality exposure &ndash; a full-on TFA/TFL style blurb about the subject, in which the news itself is mentioned but is not the sole purpose of the blurb. I'm tentatively suggesting that quality be the only consideration (provided a subject is in the news), to prevent relatively subjective discussions about whether a particular piece of news is important enough. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  16:17, 11 May 2012 (UTC) :I was musing a somwhat similar idea last night but didn't actually raise it anywhere.  Instead of a running order of teasers in the ITN box use an extended extract from just one story, replaced as and when a new story comes along that is ready.  It might help alleviate the staleness problem we've had recently and at the same time it would implicitly enforce the update requirement more strongly - after all any extract is going to focus on the updated element even if it is part of the wider article so obviously a one-sentence non-update doesn't fit the bill.  However, in some situations some editorialising would be needed to put the updated content into context - that isn't a show-stopper but is more work somewhere along the line. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 16:39, 11 May 2012 (UTC).  This is a very interesting idea. It's been stressed repeatedly that ITN is not a venue to simply ''report the news''. Its underlying mission is still to showcase articles on this encyclopedia (and, to add to that, to have a convenient place where people can click on things they are interested in, in a timely and accessible fashion). This proposal would incentivize editors to contribute to articles detailing recent events much the same way DYK incentivizes creation of new articles. I envision that a 'queue' is drawn up and articles are placed on the main page after they undergo some scrutiny from the community (C-class minimum is a good standard, but also sufficient updates and a reference check).  I would also like to put forth the idea of '''ditching the ITN blurb''' (I don't understand everything Main-Page has to be a blurb!), or at least reducing its use. This way, it could save the discussions and arguments over blurb nuance, allow for a greater number of articles to be posted at any given time, and also prevent the blurb from featuring only ''a segment'' of the article that may only be of cursory importance. For example, the recent Greek elections: we posted a relatively inconsequential detail (who won a plurality) when we could wait until the dust settles to post who actually ''formed government''. Doing away with the blurb would solve this problem: the reader would simply click and read the article itself (which is what we want the reader to do anyway).  Another reason for this is so we can showcase articles that are well updated but often get bogged down in 'support-oppose' style discussions at ITN/C, such as the NCAA March Madness debate that has now become an "annual ITN tradition". Effectively we can have a topical section on sports, in which we can provide links to the recent sporting events of wide interest. The NCAA guys would be happy that their article gets posted on the main page (they dedicate ''a lot'' of time updating it meticulously), and the community wouldn't be so put off that it is taking an entire blurb space on the page. Plus the reader benefits.  Yet another reason to have a 'topical article' idea is that it would incentivize updates to "minority topic" articles. Let's say we have five topics, just for starters: sports, disasters, politics, business and science. Let's say each topic showcases three articles dealing with recent events at any given time. We know that politics articles update more often, therefore are more likely to get 'recycled' off of the page more often. Science articles have higher lag time (as of now), so a user creating an article or updating an article about a recent event in the science category would understand that the science article will stick longer on the main page. Therefore for a veteran contributor, he might choose to contribute to science articles over a politics article just so his work can appear on the main page for a longer time (perhaps this will even out the "minority topics coverage" over time). To add onto that, to curb systemic bias, some incentive can also be given for users to create articles that deal with undercovered areas. <P>Anyway, I am optimistic that we all have the same goals in mind, and I am glad someone proposed a bold, fresh, thought-provoking idea!

As they said;  <blockquote><b>I now suggest that wikipedia have a campaign to teach editors that TIME is very important in editing.<br /><br />In articles I often come across references to things such as "recent" "current" "currently" "last few years" "last few decades" "last century" etc. These are obviously silly and have no place in an encyclopedia.<br /><br />So. 1. editors need to be made aware NOT to use such phrases 2 Someone should make a robot which searches for phrases like this and flags them as POSSIBLE TIME PROBLEMS</b></blockquote>  What is the feasibility of such a bot being developed?  There are evident advantages to a bot. It will assist in dealing with actual in line content rather than focusing upon whole pages. It should be able to highlight pages with multiple issues and priorities them and assist in targeting copy editors to the most needy cases. It would act to target experienced eyes and minds where they can be most valuable, and they are also most likely to pick up multiple issues.   Of course the idea may be totally infeasible for wiki, but I would prefer that to be shown to be the case rather than it being assumed to be the case. It could be a great bot and tool is lost for the want of a nail.

For example, in direct quotes these types of phrases should not be tagged. And in a phrase such as "In the last few years of the 20th century", "last few years" is entirely clear. The word "current" has many different meanings (see all sections besides the first of [[current (disambiguation)]]), and words such as "current", "recent", and "currently" may not be a problem when discussing events on a [[geological time scale]]. : Your best bet would be to have someone periodically analyze a [[WP:DD|database dump]] to generate a list of articles for humans to manually go through; I'm not sure whether this is in the ambit of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Check Wikipedia]], or whether they focus more on technical and syntactic issues rather than semantic issues. [[User:Anomie|Anomie]][[User talk:Anomie|⚔]] 15:02, 19 May 2012 (UTC) ::Thanks for the response [[User:Anomie|Anomie]] - it would seem that the use of the term Bot is misleading. It would seem that "Tool" or maybe "Script" is a better description. Thanks for helping focus the language.<br /><br />I have anticipated the argument that "Quotations" would be an issue. It is relatively simple when content is parsed to ignore everything within quotation marks.<br /><br />I don't believe that using a Database dump is useful or practical. It takes the focus away from wiki itself and the edit window. A correctly formatted tool/script along the lines of a Java script that keeps focus where it is needed.<br /><br />Headings such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_currently_active_military_vehicles Category:Lists_of_currently_active_military_vehicles] show just how mixed up the language is. On the page there are many forms of Cron Language from "Active" to "Currently Active". Does "Currently Active" mean an aircraft has to be in the air to count? The recognised phrase would be "In Service", but it does not feature at all. "In Service" is itself Cron Language. Any tool would need to link certain words and phrases for searching such as "Military"+"Active"or"Currently" to parse down to pages that need the eyes of copy editors.<br /><br />I would advise looking for the following using the wiki search engine "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%22currently+airing%22 | currently airing]". Does it identify pages that are about the subject, or is it identifying pages that have an air of advertising and marketing about them that may need some attention?<br /><br />The Guild of copy editors are themselves focusing upon Cron Language [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Guild_of_Copy_Editors/Projects#Turn_of_the_century|Turn Of The Century]]<br /><br />The word "presently" keeps cropping up. I found one entry that caught my eye concerning a rather rare and precious gem which is described as "Presently" being in [[Darya-ye_Noor|The Iranian Crown Jewels]]. I did not know that one of the world's rarest gems is for sale! Who do I pay? P^) <br /><br />Presently, as adverb, is not being used correctly. The entry should be in the simple present tense, denoting a fact that continues into the future. The English language has no True Future Tense, other tenses are modified to talk about the future. Here we have an unintended time shift that indiactes I can buy a rather nice gem. My guess is it is linked to a translation issue.<br /><br />I have noticed: ::* that when you find Cron language, it has a high incidence on pages that are already tagged with other issues.<br /> ::* that on many of these pages the language in general indicates that it has been translated into English, or the person who has written the page is not First Language English. Other languages have very different tense structures to English, and unskilled direct translation often introduces Cron Language in error.  ::*Frequently, linked citations are either wrong or incorrectly formatted or both.    ::* Cron Language keeps on cropping up on pages that have a very high level of edits identified only by IP address and where there are observable issues over COI. When you check the IP you find it linked to those with clear COI. ::* There are templates to deal with specific date and cron issues [[Template:Update_after|Update After]] and [[WP:ASOF]], and that shows just how important Time is to referencing and validity of content.   ::I did a quick test with google and looked for pages with the template for "additional citations" which produced over 600,000. I double checked that for just the word "Presently" and got over 180000 results.<br /><br />I then checked for copy edit template and found 3500. Cross reference that with "Presently and you get 1800 hits. It would seem that when copy editing is identified as a need it has a better correlation with overall issues and clean up. And that is just looking at one term in the pantheon of "Cron Language".<br /><br />I'm no copy editor. My eyes and mind work in different ways, but I can see just how those eyes and minds can be better utilised and empowered. I also see that there is little information available on how to use existing resources to locate issues within wiki that copy editors are experts in fixing. Catscan is one resource but it does not allow the needed analysis. Any tool may need to reference a specialist tag which would identify that a page has been copy edited and not changed since. It could be referenced to the talk page so that an entry there saying that phrase "Blah Blah" was reviewed and passed (date) would exclude the wiki page entry from any generated lists. That way if a new edit has introduced new or further Cron language it can be readily flagged for a revisit, review and re-tagged. It would allow the copy editors to do Quick Jobs easily rather than having a massive focus upon in depth copy editing. There is also wider application for hunting down and addressing many other forms of language - "Purported" gets some interesting results. Purported by who - when - how? Where did the allegation, inference or claim come from? It flags up so many missing citations it's fascinating.<br /><br />Presently, when you look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit Wikipedia articles needing copy edit] it is clear that articles with high levels of needed input have been tagged. The smaller issues which are equally important and even rapidly addressed are being missed. There are presently no tools to empower the copy editors to locate and address the far larger incidence of Cron Language misuse - and which can be dealt with faster. Using the wiki search engine just returns list of pages that is hard to manage - and if a piece of Cron language is found to be valid, it still keeps being pulled up even after it has been addressed.<br /><br />A valid tool or script that empowers people to track down Cron Language - and potentially other forms of language that can be just as insidious - would even allow people with different levels of skill as copy editors to focus where they can best be utilised, and it can even be used as a training aide for mentorship of rising copy editors.

And you know what, the theories are wrong!! Have they even tried to see if their theories are correct? NO. Unfortunately the search box in wikipedia is broken. Try searching for "currently". But if you use google https://www.google.co.nz/search?sourceid=chrome&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF-8&q=site%3Aen.wikipedia.org+%22currently%22 ..... Try "last few years" and the result is the same ie LOTS of pages that could be improved, not many negative hits. Try "last few decades". So now I make more suggestions: # Anyone who is an administrator and does something wrong or thoughtless or negative loses a point. After they lose three points they lose their administration. # Fix the wikipedia search box so that if you use "" you get what you search for # Make a robot to flag (not change) time dependent words.  # Make a robot that saves me having to type tildas all the time for my signature.

The editor apparently wanted the statement to say something like "In 2012, everyone believes Y", which is a silly way of indicating a belief that has existed for decades, or "As of 2:57 a.m. GMT on January 3, 1953, when public opinion instantly and radically changed to something very different from the views in the Middle Ages, everyone now believes Y", which would have been wrong. ::I think there is a lot of room for improvement, but mindlessly flagging statements that are both accurate and verifiable because they might (or might not) need to be updated in another decade or two is not helpful.

If someone could get their hands on a New York Times or a LA Times or a Washington Post from December 14, 1990, they would find a review of Woody Interruptus.

That made me realize that we have a chronic problem on our hands.   So, how is the situation with out of date articles in fields such as life sciences, chemistry, medicine, etc.?   What I can tell you is that in the computer science project, many articles are embarrassingly outdated. I cleaned up supercomputer some time ago, and it was at least 10 years behind, if not more. Computer animation is at least 10 years behind, and I will clean it up by the end of summer probably - will be a rewrite. I came across [[Massively parallel]] now and it is at least 15 years behind, and still gives ESPRIT 1085 (1985) as an example. I will clean it up next week, but this seems to be a serious quality/reliability problem. I will not even attempt to look at all the computer networking articles in this lifetime - who knows how up to date they are?  What are people's experiences in fields such as chemistry, biology, medicine, etc.?  Now, contrast that with [[Pythagorean theorem]]. Can it go out of date within the next 5 years? Certainly not. The topic has been stable for centuries - Pythagoras is not proving theorems any more. Many of the math articles enjoy the "stable for ever" property. The same may be true of many art history articles, etc. Van Gogh and Rubens are not painting any more, of course.  Something needs to be done to mark the articles that may go out of date soon, to attract attention to them as "dynamic" topics that need attention once a year at least. As usual, the problem remains the shortage of editors. The last comment on [[Talk:Massively parallel]] was from June 2010 and they suggested a rename then, but no one seems to be even breathing there any more. The problem is that there are many far flung technical articles that are embarrassingly out of date and a list/category of some type may need to be invented for them. The current outdated tag means it is outdated now, not that it is likely to be ''chronically outdated'' unlike Van Gogh type articles.  I do not even know which articles me need ongoing attention. So some type of list/category should help identify the pages that need the most help on a routine basis. What is the best way to create this type of list/category to distinguish these from the timeless Pythagorean theorem type pages?

Both could be improved but "out of date" would not be among my first criticisms.  I'm looking primarily at [[Integrated circuit packaging]] since I have little expertise in massively parallel systems but the content there seems pretty much up to date to me.  That there are few recent sources given does not make the material out of date: on the contrary, it reflects the speed of the underlying trends.  In my experience people tends to look at the speed at which new models and speed bumps come along and confuse that with the speed of progress in the fundamentals which is generally much slower.   :Since computers are being discussed here they are actually a good example - the [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine|SSEM]] ran in 1948.  By 1960 the underlying theories for ''most'' of a current computer science degree were in place - most fundamental data structures and sorting algorithms (for example) were well known, operating systems and high level languages were in place.  By 1970 virtual memory, wide area networking, object orientation and multiprocessing had been added to the mix, and with semiconductor memory which was becoming widespread by that point the computers were very much beginning to look like they do now from a technical standpoint. :The popular computing press tends to cloud these fundamentals in endless reporting of yet another new product.  That's their job.  Out job is to be ''encyclopedic'', and take one step back and decide what is truly important for a thorough grounding.  Too many computer-related articles devolve into endless reporting of the latest products ([[Hard disk drive]] would be a good example) and neglect the fundamental broad-brush outline as a consequence.  :One final point: slapping issues templates on articles doesn't help anyone, particularly general ones as you have done to those articles.  The notes for those templates are clear that explanatory notes on the talk page describing the perceived problem should be left: without those no-one can fix the issue, and indeed no-one knows to remove the templates when the issus ''are'' fixed. Since there is no rationale anywhere I am removing those templates now, feel free to add them back ''with'' a rationale that is detailed enough to be acted upon.

[[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 15:47, 4 June 2012 (UTC)   === Chemistry ===  Sorry in advance for this wall of text about chemistry, but [[You Asked for It|since the door is open I'll give some thoughts]]; I'll section it so other fields can be separately seen. In the realm of chemical articles (not chemicals that are primarily of interest to medicine), very few articles are likely to become seriously outdated. Of the zillions (to us the technical term) of articles about specific chemicals, most are either niche chemicals that have little ongoing development or major industrial or common-experience chemicals that are well-established and at most might have a new application or properties discovered or become subject to some new regulation or study. But the facts likely don't change, just new chemical-articles created and more details added to old ones as someone has interest in them. Unlike advanced computer science or medicine, the study of chemicals doesn't generally "advance", and the articles aren't written from the perspective of tracking the latest [item or use] as a milestone except in certain small areas of active research. There are some sections of chemicals-articles content that do become dated, generally pertaining to current industrial trends (country or company producing the most; worldwide output or consumption; regulatory or environmental-impact concerns) and a very few chemicals derive their notability from being the "most X known" (latest in an ongoing development series, or an extreme of some chemical or physical property). I don't know enough about our current state of medicinal-chemical articles to know how much of their content is tied to their current medicinal status (either intrinsically or could-be-once-someone-adds-that-important-missing-info-to-them).  Another division of our chemistry articles is the set about specific reactions and about general structure-types (functional-groups) and details of them (types of bonds, aspects of stability). Some of these definitely do get dated because new reactions are often developed as extensions of old ones, long-ignored ones become popular by a new application or modification, or recent research into specific details becomes available. But most of these cases are dated by omission of recent work rather than becoming no-longer-correct over time. In at least some cases, the new material winds up in a new article forward/back-linked to the existing one because the new material is really a self-contained topic rather than just a more advanced bit of the old.  A third division might probably chemical-analysis (techniques and equipment, etc). Here is a place where things may well become dated and lose correctness. There really are advances in equipment and ways of doing experiments. While the theories-articles are fine (though perhaps not having the latest details added), the experimental applications do change (and not just by new ways being added with retention of the old ways in common use). For example, advances in materials and engineering make increasingly powerful types of lab instruments in a genre possible, and advances in signal handling migrate from analog to digital to more powerful computers with multidimensional numerical analysis, etc. [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] ([[User talk:DMacks|talk]]) 05:37, 22 May 2012 (UTC)  :Thank you for the analysis. So the way I understand it as a non-chemist is that the chemical structure of salt is not going to change next year, but the equipment for chemical analysis is likely to be dynamic, of course. And the chemical theories may change, but the basic concepts are likely to stay stable. Is that right? Now, how do you suggest "marking" the dynamic pages so they are distinguished from the very static pages?

Things like biophysics, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology come to mind.  Synthetic chemistry, as DMacks explained, is a mature science where the core principles are known and are not likely to be changed.  New chemicals and reactions will continue to be discovered at the margins, but it is unlikely that there will be a discovery that will cause well-established articles to become outdated.  On the other hand, some articles in the more avant-garde fields will need to be updated more frequently, since in these fields the current state of the art may be completely superseded within a couple of years.  As far as the technical side, what would be our goal with such a system to mark dynamic pages?  Are we merely trying to encourage someone to review each of these articles every few years?  It seems that this is better done on the WikiProject level; perhaps there could be a category for "articles likely to become outdated", activated through an option on the WikiProject banner.  Perhaps such a category could be used to identify priority articles during a periodic WikiProject article improvement drive?  We could also think up a system which allows an editor to endorse articles as being up-to-date as of a specific date, again maybe through WikiProject banners, with older endorsements signaling a need for the article to be revisited.  Of course, the case needs to be made that there is a problem and that a proposed system solves it, to justify the extra bureaucratic overhead.

[[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 06:10, 25 May 2012 (UTC)  == Quality-tracking system ==  My 6-years experience in wikipedias shows that we have not enough active users to watch all articles, such as that each article be watched by at least one active user. Hence, Wikipedia apparently has a lot of pending damage (pages which were improperly edited, or not yet edited after a degradation); see my new essay [[Wikipedia:Shoot it early]]. In future, the ratio of articles to editors become even higher and the problem become worse. I propose to consider an approach opposite to "Flagged revisions". Namely, to store some data (including a pointer to revision) about each ''section'' of each ''article'', instead of storing some data about ''each revision''.  The proposed system should be able: * To have several degrees of quality, such as perfect&nbsp;(5), fine&nbsp;(4), doubtful/controversial&nbsp;(3), unsourced&nbsp;(2), ungrammatical/unformatted&nbsp;(1), unchecked/raw&nbsp;(0). * To track renaming and rearranging of sections, at least for most edits. This is probably the most difficult technically. * To have a set of records (quality,&nbsp;revision,&nbsp;expert) for each section, which should point to major improvements (including creation) of the section. "Expert" should be any registered user, unless this privilege was explicitly denied. * To provide possibility of adding such records both for ongoing edits (for which expert&nbsp;=&nbsp;author) and retrospectively. Any "expert" (see the previous item) should be able to add a record or to upgrade its "quality" value. * To raise an alert (such as highly visible mark in watchlist and the edit history) if a section previously rated at&nbsp;least&nbsp;(3) disappeared without explanations. * To allow altering (downgrading and deleting) there records to people with the "reviewer" privilege (shared with FlaggedRevs). * By customization, to display, below or near the section's header, a coloured bar (corresponding to registered quality) and links to several of recently registered revisions. The latter is the thing which can ultimately make the system useful for tracking casual degradations.  What is wrong with [[WP: Flagged revisions]]? Let a reviewer to spot some edit. It has then three easy options. If s/he marks the edit as reviewed, then s/he virtually become responsible for it, although s/he may not be an expert in this particular matter. Reverting an edit is also a responsibility, and may constitute a newcomer's biting or provoke an edit war. If s/he choose to do nothing, it will increase the backlog of unchecked edits which will gradually weaken the entire system.  Instead, the proposed system prompts to check edits not on the spot, but when someone reads (and especially intends to do something with), say, a particular section. If a user sees <span style="background-color:#00FF00">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</span> near the header, but the section is poor, it can mean that either the section was degraded since the last evaluation (which can easily be checked against aforementioned links to old revisions) or someone abused the "expert" feature (which may be deterred administratively). In the opposite case, if a reader feels that a section is underestimated, it may upgrade the "quality" field. Also, we may introduce a special (negative) "warning" quality level, to indicate that "expert" is actually not an expert, but feels that the so-labeled edit is problematical.  Although such system is very complex, it possibly will be more resistant to misinformation than FlaggedRevs, and will be much more convenient than searching the history for any doubtful stuff. [[User:Incnis Mrsi|Incnis Mrsi]] ([[User talk:Incnis Mrsi|talk]]) 16:29, 2 June 2012 (UTC)  : Yes, this system looks very complex, hard to use and implement. And if you make it a little less automatic, you will get simple tags (like "<nowiki>{{unreferenced}}</nowiki>" or "<nowiki>{{POV}}</nowiki>"). However, the actual system of tags seems to be far more flexible, able to show more than one problem. : In the end, if the matter is of any importance, the reader ''must'' check everything he reads on Wikipedia. There are no workarounds for that. We can help this process by giving the reader sources, showing the edit history and talk page, but we should do nothing that could give the reader the idea that the text is "reliable" and nothing has to be done. --[[User:Martynas Patasius|Martynas Patasius]] ([[User talk:Martynas Patasius|talk]]) 21:09, 2 June 2012 (UTC) ::The problem of the declining user:article ratio is definitely a concern and something that will have to be dealt with in the future.

It would promote discussion of the edit because when the rollbacker attempted the rollback they would instead see a message stating something to the effect "This is a trusted user who is exempt from rollback. To modify their edit you must manually append a revision or request an administrator perform the automated procedure. It is highly probable that discussion is the most appropriate next step." and it would quell the current form of edit war common with vandals who restore their own edit right after being rolled back, in continuous cycle until they are blocked.

A rollback edit war is rare, because the sort of vandals who will repeatedly restore an unwanted edit generally do not have access to rollback, or any of the various similar tools.  All the edits at [[Miami cannibal attack]] given as an example above are manual edits, and that is the common pattern for edit wars.  Disabling the potential for rollback/automated-reversion for any of those edits wouldn't have altered the course of events.  Preventing ''all'' reversion to a given article text is effectively enshrining the 1-revert-rule, which is not in line with current policy (nor, I think, would it be a good idea).

This is overwhelmingly a good thing -- we don't want bots bombarding Wikipedia with spam -- however, it is a bit disruptive if you are a good-faith human IP. Would it be possible/a good idea to create a whitelist of websites that obviously are not going to be used abusively, I say this because I made [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epinephrine&diff=488855167&oldid=488850805 this] edit recently which introduced an external link in a reference to [[PubMed Central]], upon which I was presumably placed on ArbCom's most wanted list for being a malicious spambot advertising ...

This must cover television programmes, stations, <s>schedules, magazines,</s> advertisements, and anything else related to television, such a television itself from any company, like [[Sony]]. It cannot limit itself to fiction, and notability of fiction itself is... vague to define nowadays, as [[WP:notability (fiction)]] is an essay. Currently, there is not yet one proposed notability guideline of television. It may look suitable for elsewhere, but I think this must be the right place. Any volunteers?  --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 16:04, 11 June 2012 (UTC)  : Is there a reason to think that the general guideline ([[Wikipedia:Notability]]) is insufficient? Also, are you sure, that grouping all those topics under "television" makes more sense than alternatives (for example, TV stations would seem to have more in common with radio stations than with TV advertisements)..? --[[User:Martynas Patasius|Martynas Patasius]] ([[User talk:Martynas Patasius|talk]]) 17:53, 11 June 2012 (UTC)  :: The '''first question''': well, I'm thinking inclusion and exclusion of notability, as [[WP:PORNBIO]] has done already. Recaps of programs (fictional plot or event summary) may have been mistaken for evidence of notability, so, even if one might pass GNG, the show might fail such criteria of inclusion or exclusion, or the other way around... Also, the awards might or might not prove notability, but look at [[Woody Interruptus]]: it won the Best Director award that has nothing to do with the plot itself, and there is no commentary about or awards contributed by the plot. Even ratings don't help much. [[Access Hollywood]] and seasons of [[Survivor (TV series)]]... do they pass GNG? If so, how? Amount of episodes and episodes themselves... must they be proof of notability? [[KDOC]] could be notable because of news coverage about this station and its background, but... that's all I can say, unless it fails GNG. :: The '''second question''': amount of television topics is diversive, regardless of what television and radio stations have in common. Television and radio are different from each other; you hear people talking or singing in radio; you see and hear things in television. Look at [[WP:notability (people)]]; it is diversive with human beings, yet they have nothing in common, unless I'm wrong. However, if television stations must be excluded from the guidelines, then how can I disambiguate "television"? It's a broad term, but I crossed out schedules and magazines, anyway: maybe [[WP:notability (television programme)]], which includes fictional and non-fictional programs, advertisements? Must I be missing the point or something? --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 19:38, 11 June 2012 (UTC)  ::: Actually, first of all, those questions were meant to develop your proposal, not to criticise it... Thus I will leave much of what you said for someone else... ::: But anyway, I expected something similar to, let's say, the case of Juozas Idzelis... He was a member of Lithuanian Constituent Seimas (1922-07-13 - 1922-11-13) and there is a page given to him in the encyclopedic dictionary of such members, but that page is almost empty, as little is known about him. Thus it is not clear if that is "significant coverage", but I guess that notability is demonstrated by having someone giving an effort to collect the data and publish it in a serious publication. And we know that members of such legislatures do get such attention, thus we can make a more specific guideline (or just apply [[WP:IAR]], for we do have a reason). Now, maybe you can give an example of a TV program for which a similar case can be made (notability or lack of it could be clearly demonstrated to almost anyone - inclusionist or deletionist - but the general guideline would give a different - or borderline - answer)? Or maybe you can show that there are some "shortcuts" - conditions that would be easy to check and would indicate presence of coverage in suitable sources? Or maybe you can give examples of suitable and non-suitable "almost borderline" coverage - I guess that might also be useful for such guidelines? --[[User:Martynas Patasius|Martynas Patasius]] ([[User talk:Martynas Patasius|talk]]) 21:36, 11 June 2012 (UTC) :::: Asian television shows last for normally 20 to 30 episodes because... Asian writers do that very often. ''[[The Greed of Man]]'' lasted for 40 episodes in just one year, yet it is not short-lived because... it is an Asian show that can last for one year, like other shows from Asia. It might be notable in so many ways, like Impact the show did. Even many Asian television shows do not fall under definition of short-lived, especially [[Anime]]s. Even Latin American shows (e.g. [[telenovela]]s) last for one year because... it's a [[telenovela]], like ''[[Yo soy Betty, la fea]]'' and ''[[Los Ricos También Lloran]]''. Television show is defined differently in many countries. --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 21:51, 11 June 2012 (UTC)  ::::: OK, so we have something that might be promising: "''It might be notable in so many ways, like Impact the show did.''". But you should be more precise: what sort of "impact"? Did the show inspire most of its viewers to start some sort of regime change right after the premiere? If it did, it would be easy to persuade everyone that it was notable. But then, we would need sources to show that it did, and the program would be notable by the general guideline as well... And, well, I don't think you had such impact in mind... So, what exactly did you mean? ::::: And the number of episodes doesn't seem to be an obvious indicator of notability. It doesn't even seem hard to make a show with many episodes, if there are no requirements for quality... ::::: There is one more thing you might wish to try: make a list of deletion discussions that, er, had some problems now and would have had less if there was a guideline you propose. Then, for each of them, explain why do you think so. ::::: And finally, there is some danger that, unless we have enough good sources about something (thus proving that we deal with the object that is notable according to the general guideline), we won't be able to write an article worth reading (and keeping)... You might wish to read [[User:Uncle G/Cargo cult encyclopaedia article writing]] about some of potential dangers... By the way, for all I know, a couple of other essays by the same author - [[User:Uncle G/On notability]] and [[User:Uncle G/On sources and content]] - might also be a source of inspiration while preparing the guideline and the case for it... --[[User:Martynas Patasius|Martynas Patasius]] ([[User talk:Martynas Patasius|talk]]) 23:36, 11 June 2012 (UTC) :::::: For anime if there are alot of episodes to it chances are that it ios going to have other things to it that meet [[WP:N]].

WP:FICT was a notability guideline at a time, and the debate took many ''years'', before ending up as ''no consensus'' (over 50+ pages of archives). Also note that by the end of the discussions (end 2009), many editors were tired of participating, and did not participate in discussions anymore.

After all thought about television, what if I can split up this whole idea into many TV-related ideas: [[WP:notability (non-fictional television)]], [[WP:notability (television commercials)]], and [[WP:notability (fictional television)]]? Therefore, one group can focus on non-fictional stuff that happens on television, such as news programs, instructional stuff, animal programs, etc. Another group can... let's get into fiction later. I'm not sure about television commercials; notability of commercials are very rare nowadays and do not reach the levels of [[1984 (advertisement)]]. Let's start with non-fictional stuff, shall we? --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 05:20, 12 June 2012 (UTC)  : Well, there is one more idea from those discussions... In one of them you write: "''Soap opera recaps about this character in any editions of a periodical, such as Soap Opera Weekly or Soap Opera Digest, to me, do not count as "significant coverages," unless they are proven to determine notability of this character.''". So, write an essay explaining that and giving examples of "significant coverage" and "insignificant coverage" of characters, shows or something else. Such essays would seem to be ''exactly'' what we lack at the moment, ''explaining'' the general guideline. Otherwise, I don't see anything that could ''replace'' the general notability guideline in those cases. --[[User:Martynas Patasius|Martynas Patasius]] ([[User talk:Martynas Patasius|talk]]) 19:02, 12 June 2012 (UTC) :: Here is one of my essays yet in development: [[User:George Ho/Notability (character)]]. --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 19:08, 12 June 2012 (UTC)  ::: Good.

I saw a fundraising banner a day or so ago. Was it just my imagination or are they doing fundraising more than once a year now?  As you recall we talked about [[Right time marketing]] a few months ago. I saw the banner once, and it had a picture of Jimmy Wales and a request for funds. But that was it. It was not repeated. If they are experimenting with that I think they should not just place the banner once at random. That will get minimal results and may cause them to abandon that approach. A user typically needs to see the banner 3-7 times to respond. Once is never enough. That requires that registered users be targeted first and a count is kept of how many times they have seen the banner. The key to that type of message is repetition, but not over-repetition.   So, if they are placing fundraising banners somewhat at random, do talk them into doing them at least 3 times (but 5 is preferred) for registered users, if they are to be effective. And please do say that the results of a random placement experiment can not be relied upon. Repetition, and right time marketing are essential for the success of this experiment.  Please let me know. Thanks. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 21:52, 14 June 2012 (UTC) :You came across a banner test.  The fundraising team runs them (for an hour at a time) every now and then throughout the year.  Mostly they are doing A/B tests on things like language or form performance.  Long-term testing is not needed in this case; the data gathered in only an hour is more than sufficient for answering the questions posed. --[[User:Jorm (WMF)|Jorm (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Jorm (WMF)|talk]]) 22:31, 14 June 2012 (UTC)  ::I beg to differ on that. I think they are throwing money away not doing right time marketing. I know there is $20M in the bank, but if things go south they will wish they had $40M. 12 months is a long time to wait for new funds. I think they can get 25% to 35% more by fundraising throughout the year by right time marketing. I would have paid again if they had hit me the right way.

There really isn't a one-size-fits-all solution.  For example, donations through the Arabic Wikipedia might be higher if we ran the campaign a month from now rather than at the end of the (tax) year.

Not stopping to read a message is not an excuse for continuing spaming, but I think this is a problem in that it would be better to make the user additionally aware that there is some more urgent going on than someone merely trying to send them a message so that the user more likely stops to see what that might be. To address this, perhaps the background color of the User talk notification can be tied to (1) the [[Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace]] being posted and (2) the permission of the editor posting the user warning. In other words, if an admin posted a series of user warnings like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.77.177.189&oldid=484899014 these], the color of the User talk notification should change to match the escalating warnings, with the last "You have new messages" notification background being red. (The color of the User talk notification would not change if a non-admin posted the same user warnings.)

Firstly the discussion appeared thorough and systematically refined the approach with each collaborative step. The exchanges appear to have been nearly intuitive, implying the technicians could emerge the task of development with hair intact. And there were significant expressions regarding this ability as useful; which I agree. I have but one reservation, and hope it does not constitute a monkey wrench to the idea. I believe the original summary should be logged to an archive for future inspection and concurrently believe the amended summary should carry an identifying feature which clearly shows the summary had changed while linking to the archive location for the original.

For example, it shows that History is what Wikipedia is most interested in, that COIs should be less aggressive and easier to work with and research (citations) is what the community needs most to improve articles. The idea is to help companies understand what Wikipedia wants. Many organizations have decades or centuries of rich history they're proud of and their heritage department could provide a lot of research to help improve these pages, but instead product marketing is spamming Wikipedia with promotional product information.   I was thinking of what other report could educate companies on the community's desires and I wonder if a structured survey would also help understand consensus on Wikipedia. Today there are many contradicting claims as to what consensus is on the issue and an understanding of community sentiment could educate companies off of Wikipedia, while guiding the debate on Wikipedia. Thoughts?  {{collapsetop|An initial thrown-together draft of possible survey questions}} * Do you frequently edit articles on companies or products? * Have you edited a company page on a brand that you are a customer of? * What percent of companies would you guess would be able to make substantial content contributions to Wikipedia that are of value with minimal help? * Would you post quality content that meets Wikipedia's policies and guidelines to a Wikipedia article regardless of the source? * What percent of company articles would you guess have been edited by the company? * Do you think most company articles could be improved with encyclopedic information that reflects positively on the company? * Do you feel the community's collaborations with companies would be improved if they had access to expertise on the rules of engagement and Wikipedia's content needs? * How many hours of time commitment do you think a marketing professional would need to make reading, practicing and learning the skills necessary to make substantial, acceptable content contributions despite their COI? * Would you be less likely to collaborate with a company in good faith after prior editing behavior from them violated Wikipedia’s policies and guidelines? * Generally, you think Wikipedia should (a) ban all paid editors (b) we can't stop them, so might as well let them do it transparently (c) Good encyclopedic content is always welcome - the issue is only with Wikiepdia's policies, guidelines and general neutrality * Regarding substantial content contributions, you think company representatives should be allowed to (a) edit the page directly (b) edit the page directly, but only if their contributions are good (c) only contribute through Talk pages as a rule of thumb  {{collapsebottom}} [[User:King4057]] 18:02, 24 June 2012 (UTC)  :What about a Wiki master editor that uses it for nothing but a traffic generator?

As an example article, take a look at this: [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)]]  The first three sentences are a really nice lead.  There are suitable links to other articles.  But imagine a user who has no familiarity with the subject - inserting a first sentence saying that this is a computer CPU would help.  As it stands users might not be sure whether this item is a CPU or GPU or some other IC used in computing.  Compare with any article about a US president. The first line says "$PERSON was blah blah blah and Xth president of the United States beween $YEAR_START and $YEAR_END"  There are some problems with this.  * Simple English is very hard to write well.  Simple English about technical subjects is harder to write. * Being correct (using "useful lies") is troublesome for an encyclopaedia.  Often a simple English description might use language which is truthful but not fully pedantically rigorously correct.  I think this is okay, so long as the lead acknowledges the short-comings.  --[[Special:Contributions/31.126.231.18|31.126.231.18]] ([[User talk:31.126.231.18|talk]]) 22:26, 16 June 2012 (UTC) :We have a Simple English Wikipedia.

Still, to expect it to briefly explain a CPU is too much - that might be feasible for such a short article, but other articles cover such a wide scope that it's already difficult to summarize everything in four paragraphs. Simple English Wikipedia might not develop fast enough to address the issue, so it's a good thing we have wikilinks. The reader can go from Ivy Bridge to CPU, and then from CPU to computer and so on. There are too many subpar leads, though. Maybe we could implement some interface for systemically going through leads and improving them. You don't need knowledge of the subject to do that, only writing skills. I think improving all leads would greatly enhance the reader's experience, because when the lead summarizes the article properly, that's all the information most readers are looking for. <span style="text-shadow:#FFFF66 0.7px 0.7px 0.7px; class=texhtml">[[user:Junglejill|<font color="#669900">''ʝungle''</font>]][[User_talk:Junglejill|<font color="009900">''jill''</font>]]</span> 23:04, 17 June 2012 (UTC)  This is a great suggestion, imo, but I don't know how we can action this on a community-level.

Likewise, to determine which term is more widely used *outside* of Wikipedia: Google for <code>"layout engine" -site:wikipedia.org</code> and <code>"browser engine" -site:wikipedia.org</code>. [[User:LittleBenW|LittleBen]] ([[User talk:LittleBenW|talk]]) 11:49, 30 June 2012 (UTC) :Category titles seem to change at the whim of the editor and I see a lot of time spent re-categorizing articles, so I'm not sure if there is any standard to follow there. Article titles typically follow the [[Wikipedia:Article titles]] policy, but it doesn't really discuss how to research and determine what the most appropriate title would be. Determining the title through Google hits would find the most common title, which might be the most appropriate but I'm not really sure.

It takes such a lot of effort to clean up the resultant mess that that more and more editors seem to be giving up trying.   :::If you search Wikipedia for an article "ABCDEF" then you will be told "You may create the page "ABCDEF", but consider checking the search results below to see whether the topic is already covered." Note that basic Wikipedia Search does not search Categories, and it's quite difficult to find out [[Help:Searching|how to do this]]. I'd think that the obvious solution would be to add Category search to basic search.  Then searching Wikipedia for an article "ABCDEF" would very probably find a Category "ABCDEF" containing an article on "ABCDEF" but under a different name. I have suggested that basic Wikipedia Search should include Category search, to no effect.   :::Another part of a solution would be to modify the search results something like as follows: "You may create a page named "ABCDEF", but consider checking the search results below to see whether the topic is already covered. '''Also be aware of [[Wikipedia:Article titles|Wikipedia Article naming guidelines]]'''." However, the present [[Wikipedia:Article titles|article naming guidelines]] don't suggest that you should search Categories and try to create article names that are consistent with Category names and with other articles in related Categories. I tried to add information on how to do this to [[Wikipedia:Article titles]] and [[Wikipedia:Categorization/Naming]], but my edits were reverted. Wikipedia seems to have quite a few editors who follow others (particularly new editors) around, reverting their work (without saying a word) rather than attempting to help or to solve problems in a spirit of goodwill.

I hope it's not too discouraging in your case. Regarding article titles, I'm really not an expert on our polices and I don't really know if we have something to cover the best way to determine what an article title should be. I will say in general, if there's no guideline for something people will often create an essay (per [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia essays]]) and ask for input from the community. Then they'll propose that the essay become a guideline (per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines#Life cycle]]). This usually happens when somebody, such as yourself, see a need to clarify something. Wikipedia is quite chaotic in how it develops and it might be possible nobody has thought about this issue and that you are the expert in this area. Perhaps you might like to start a guideline such as [[Wikipedia:Article naming guideline]] if we don't have anything already. I'll ask our resident expert to chime in here to see if we already have something. Best regards.

The best research method depends on the field (e.g., web search results are good for software, but weak for medicine).  The best title depends on your [[personal and cultural values]].  For example, we have some people who firmly believe that the best possible title for an article about a person is always the person's full, legal name ("William Jefferson Clinton").  We also have people who believe that the best title uses initials for the first name ("S. R. Rana").  We also have people who believe that academic titles ought to be included ("Prof. Richard Dawkins").  None of these personal and cultural preferences are "right" or "wrong".  We can easily find reliable sources that back up each of them, because our sources have personal and cultural preferences, too.  We already provide advice on what the community most commonly chooses in such situations, but there are times when we reject the common approach and choose another.  There is no single answer.  There is no single criterion that always trumps the others.

(This is needed because basic Wikipedia search does not search categories, and many or most experienced users don't know how to search categories—you need to know how to find Advanced search). This would help authors of new articles choose article names and category names that are reasonably consistent. Given the importance of Category search, and the fact that few people can work out how to do it, surely it would make a lot of sense to alias the Category search button up one level (to the same level as the Advanced search button) in the box below the [[Special:search|Special search]] box so that one doesn't have to know to click on the Advanced search button in order to find Category search?

Sure, we have [[WP:Editor review]], but that has something of ''There's something wrong with'' '''''YOU''''' ''so let others tell you what it is''. Many experienced editors might not like to hear that and often it might simply be plain incorrect.  Now I can see that someone might argue that this could be abused by an editor who only wants to disrupt Wikipedia who could endlessly claim he or she is being right and all other editors misbehave. I am not entirely sure how that could be handled. Anyway it's only an idea so far. -- [[User:Toshio Yamaguchi|Toshio Yamaguchi]] ([[User talk:Toshio Yamaguchi|tlk]]−[[Special:Contributions/Toshio_Yamaguchi|ctb]]) 17:36, 8 July 2012 (UTC)  :The village water cooler perhaps? :-) The simple way to avoid your final concern is to simply make it so nothing binding can ever come out of the forum.

[[User:NCurse|NCurse]] <sub> [[User talk:NCurse|work]]</sub> 06:20, 17 July 2012 (UTC)  : Hello NCurse. I read through the presentation; it looks well done and provides a good overview. There were a few basic points it did not seem to cover (although I didn't listen to the videos): :* Wikipedia's definition of "notability" may not match people's early expectations. For example, a reliable and well-respected textbook is not necessarily considered notable on Wikipedia. Such articles may be put up for deletion, which can be frustrating for newcomers. :* We have strict provisions against copyright infringement and the use of original research. Professors and researchers should probably be made aware of the latter. :* It could mention the guidelines provided by the Manual of Style, which create a definite learning curve. :* Of the five pillars, the one that wasn't covered was civility. Even experienced editors can sometimes be a little unpleasant to deal with. : I'm sure you're probably already familiar with these points, but you did ask for feedback so I thought I'd mention some topical concerns that seemed noticeable by their absence. Still, I think the presentation will hold up just fine as it is. Thank you.

The user says "I go out of my way to look at cultural heritage sites wherever I am" and uses Wikipedia on a mobile device to find interesting places to visit.   The issue of wanting the coordinates to show up in handheld applications is an interesting one (albeit not one that should determine [[WP:Notability]]).  This was the first time I had seen this raised in a Wikipedia discussion, but I see that it also arose lst year in [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 89#Notability of cemeteries|this Village Pump (policy) discussion]], also about cemeteries.  Since many individual items that are geolocatable and could be of interest to a person with a handheld device are typically covered in broader articles, there is likely to be increasing demand for a way to broadcast multiple geolocations associated with a single Wikipedia article. It is something that would be needed for most all Wikimedia projects. Is anybody aware of, or working on, a link/redirect function that could include (and broadcast) the geolocation data for multiple elements in a single article? Is this feasible? --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 20:05, 17 July 2012 (UTC) : Does it work to put the geolocation data on the redirects to the merged article?

The original [[NRHP]] discussion had to do with combining articles on geolocated objects, such as [[Cuyuna Iron Range Municipally-Owned Elevated Metal Water Tanks|these 3 objects that are in a 10K range of each other]]. Currently that article is geolocated to the middle of the three objects. Are coordinates in redirects of the other two sites supposed to overwrite the coordinates on the destination page? What's wrong with creating two more articles? My remark has to do with being able to find wikipedia articles with Google. I put the link in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/St. Boniface Cemetery, Wrought-Iron Cross Site|the AfD proposal]], but here it is again: Please see [http://support.google.com/maps/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=144359 this link] for information on how to view Wikipedia articles based on geocoordinates in Google maps. I am baffled simply by the idea of putting geocoordinates in redirects - I would prefer a stub with a link back to the destination article. What I find odd about even discussing this is that I had no idea people could be so against the idea of stub creation on principle. I make stubs all the time, and I think they're great. I have seen stubs I created back in 2009 grow in all sorts of interesting ways, based on input from other Wikipedians.

[[User:Anomie|Anomie]][[User talk:Anomie|⚔]] 18:39, 19 July 2012 (UTC)  == Searching for deleted files ==  As an OTRS agent, I often get inquiries where the writer does not specify the exact article name or image name. With a little fishing, I can often figure it out. For example, if the writer is "Joe Jones", using the search will identify a number of possibilities.  However, it is quite common for them to be inquiring about a deleted article. If they have the exact article name, I can find it, but if it is not exact, I cannot. On several occasions, I have made a guess, failed to find it, and when we tracked it down, the right title was very close, sometimes only a single character different, such as an apostrophe or some other minor character.  My suggestion is simple to state, although I have no idea how hard it would be in practice:  Admins have the authority to view deleted material. If the search results could detect that an admin was making the request, and expand the search options to included deleted material, it would make it much easier to find the article name, and not have to engage in back and forth by email to track down the article.  If it is not easy for the search box to identify who is making the search, an alternative would be a search screen only accessible to admins.  As an example, suppose the author of 1970-71 Mitropa Cup writes to me and provides permission. I need to find the article and undelete it. If I copy the correct name into a search box, it won't find it, but it will suggest I create it, and when I click on it, there will be an option to undelete it. Or I can enter the name in the deletion log and see it. However, if the person writing to me says the article name is 1970-71 Mitropa Cup (using a hyphen instead of an en-dash) the search function won't find it, nor will a search of a deletion log. Those searches only get hits with exact names. I'd like the ability for admins to search, and even if it doesn't find the exact match it should show deleted names that are close to the entered name.   I assume this will only work if we index the deleted names as well.  If I know the editor's name, I can search their contributions, but editors usually write to OTRS using  their real names, and only occasionally include their user names, plus, it is quite common for the person contacting us to be someone other than the editor.    I'm starting at Idea Lab rather than Proposals, because it occurs to me that there may be other ways to accomplish my goal, or other things I need to consider before writing this up as a formal proposal.--[[User:Sphilbrick|<span style="color:#002868;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">SPhilbrick</span>]][[User talk:Sphilbrick|<span style=";padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">(Talk)</span>]] 22:03, 20 July 2012 (UTC) :Addendum: It was suggested I check Bugzilla, to see if this has been discussed.

Generally when an editor wikilinks a term in articlespace, a redlink will indicate if they did something wrong. Unprintworthy redirects deny the editor this feedback, so if I add a sentence to an article and link [[Tom Hank]] for example, I would see a blue link when I preview my changes, which simply redirects to the correct title, [[Tom Hanks]]. Now I'm rather unfamiliar with most editing bots that run on Wikipedia, but last I recall there seemed to generally be more willing programmers than viable bot purposes. Perhaps there is a bot doing this already, though I could see it being difficult for a bot to choose which print-worthy redirect to replace each typo with... *So I ask, is there a system in place to catch this type of error?

This is somewhat like the fact that admins block at their own discretion in many situations. The new userright would be created using [[:mw:Manual:$wgRevokePermissions]] on the technical level.

I know truth is dependent on  point of view, but facts are always facts.  And so much of what is on Wikipedia  is not  fact nor truth.   That is why so many schools & universities will not allow anything quoted from Wikipedia which is sad.  The greatest learning tool of this age and it is disallowed across the board by so many because there is no accountability.  Just like the politicians and popstars that scrub out certain facts from their wiki file because they are shady or do not paint them in a good  light and so much more pushed into their wiki file that is either false  or frivilious.   There has to be a editorial tool/computer program that can help make the job of managing the content and info in wiki better.  If there is not then that is what I need to work on I guess.  I'm a history major in college and know the difference between truth, fact, and opinion. And i want to help, if possible, get Wikipedia's  credibility back.

I think (and it has been shown very well) that deletion discussions, particularly speedy deletions and snowball discussions, are one of the most inhospitable environments to subject a newbie to. All too often the first article somebody creates is nominated for deletion or speedy deletion. Hell, even [[Karmakanic|my first article]] when I got serious with Wikipedia was nominated and nearly vanquished to the pits of doom. For many, it spells the end of their attempt to continue.  I think its fair to say a lot of us came to Wikipedia with a "conflict of interest" - There was something in particular we wanted to work on, and from there the story grows. I think it's important that we prevent potential editors from being scared away, and I believe XfD, specifically AfD, is the largest beast to slay in this regard. There are a few suggestions I think would jump start a transition.  There are two types of nominations at AfD that I see. The first type is new articles; the second is reoccuring nominations. The system works well for the latter type, but fails miserably with the first. Could the two be separated as a process? Perhaps if they could, the new article nominations could be set up under a process where nominations must be made using one or more of a list of predefined reasons, thereby eliminating the nominators personal opinion and making the process procedural. The snowball/pile on effect is also disheartening to new editors, and so this separated process could also possibly protect against that.  In both processes, perhaps not allowing voting for the first 48 hours would encourage editors to take time investigating the noteworthiness of the topic under review, rather than voting with their opinion or without investigating sources on the net.   I know one of the issues with watering down the way users can vote is that "we don't vote", we go by reasoning and arguments. By blocking out the reasoning it would literally become a vote. So perhaps the exact opposite would work: No voting, just reasoning as to the notability of the topic. The closing admin would determine the outcome. However, the issue here is that even prohibiting voting as it were would only hide the '''keep''', '''delete''' and '''merge''' bolding. Could we do 'blind' voting, where usernames are hidden until the vote is closed and only the comment is visible to users, thereby preventing voting by association, or cabalism.  I think it's clear that a reform is needed. Perhaps my ideas are non-starters, or they might encourage some others or some brainstorming. However, the problem has been acknowledged for quite some time, so let's do something about it!  - '''[[User:Floydian|<font color="#5A5AC5">ʄɭoʏɗiaɲ</font>]]'''&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">τ</font>]]</sup> <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">¢</font>]]</sub> 15:21, 14 July 2012 (UTC) : I agree that AfD can be an inhospitable environment, but that's mainly because of a collision between conflicting interests.

The claims that good newbies are often scared by deletion of their articles are sure common. But let's look from the other side. We tell the newbies "Be bold!" (as in [[Wikipedia:Be bold]]). We also tell them that they can be bold because their sincere mistakes can cause no lasting harm: bad edits will be reverted and - yes - bad articles will be deleted. We hear about the newbies that do not like deletion of their first article, because they complain, but are we sure there are no newbies (and, may I say, ''better'' newbies) who have looked at the deletion of their article with joy? I don't think that many of them should be expected to say anything, but it doesn't mean that they do not exist. : There is a second point. We don't need "more editors". We need more ''good'' editors. And "good" first of all means "taking criticism well", including the harsh criticism - although one should not confuse "harsh" with "impolite" or "insulting". Thus the editors we want can be expect to react to the proposal to delete their article rather well. On the other hand, the editors we don't want are more likely to react badly and end up out of Wikipedia. The process isn't perfect, but it seems to be better than nothing. : That brings me to the third point: is there some evidence that the criticism of the articles often happens to be impolite or insulting?

One of the inherent problems of AfD (like in many other places) is that anyone can !vote. Having participated on  close on 1,000 AfDs and closed many, I get a distinct impression that much  of the !voting is subjective. Perhaps a guideline that  all  !votes, whether keep, oppose, merge, etc should ''all'' be backed up by citing policies and established guidelines would lead to more consistent and more objective !voting.   Recent assurances have been given by the WMF that they are now 'revisiting'  a proposal they  made over a year go  that has remained dormant since, to create a new landing page for new users. The new landing page (working title  [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Article_Creation_Workflow Article Creation Work Flow]) would probably replace the Article Creation Wizard, and might possibly  be developed as an obligatory step for new users towards the creation of their new pages.

Perhaps if the FAC could also be used to assess whether an article satisfies the A criteria... but I think that idea has been discussed before.  : That being said, I think what really needs to be clarified is what exactly allows an article to clear the A bar without satisfying the FA criteria.

Almost any article on a company has someone on the other end wondering if they should edit it. Add a template on company pages or just on their Talk pages, perhaps through the Wikiproject Companies template, cautioning about COI and encouraging COIs to use <nowiki>{{request edit}}</nowiki> or a link to some other instructions. So that any company that views the Talk page on their own articles can get some guidance on what to do and what not to do. # Write a letter written by the community that can be sent to PR agencies and departments. Create more dialogue between the PR and Wikipedia communities. The letter might provide some guidance on what kinds of edits are universally acceptable, what universally isn't and where there's a grey area. # By and large, media humiliation has prevented the Fortune 500 from grossly unethical behavior on Wikipedia, but leaving this power in the hands of reporters, instead of with the Wikipedia community, has its shortcomings. Creating our own wall of shame, owned and operated by the community, but shared with the media, would do a better job discouraging a broader range of behavior we all agree is improper, while not shaming people who don't necessarily deserve it. It's impossible for us to play a game of wack-a-mole to try to prevent censorship and spam on Wikipedia, instead of deterring those edits from ever occurring in the first place, by letting people know their actions will be exposed (we would use examples where we couldn't remotely maintain AGF).

What you're really trying to do is add entropy to the system — more possibilities for passwords — to overwhelm a brute force attack. Of all of them, though, length is probably the most important, and [http://xkcd.com/936/ it has been] noted in many cases that trying to artificially add entropy by requiring numbers, capitals, etc., often ends up with passwords that are hard for the individual user to remember that aren't actually very hard to crack. They also lead to high amounts of password reuse across systems (in which case the weakest link compromises all log-ins) and can lead to other unsafe practices like writing the password down on sticky notes attached to their monitor. I've personally been quite irritated with sites that purport to care a lot about security (a bank I once belonged to, for example) requiring extremely short but unintuitive passwords (maximum length of 8 or something like that), when I personally prefer using passphrases (short sentences usually taken at random from a book I have around here) for their ease of remembering plus length. --[[User:Mr.98|Mr.98]] ([[User talk:Mr.98|talk]]) 11:24, 28 June 2012 (UTC)  :I am no expert so forgive my musings on this matter.

Or, as one guy I worked with did, he made almost every password he used "nameofthesite1!" Which isn't such a bad password unless you figure out the system. People have bad security practices. Remember that you're not really trying to fool actual people — you're trying to fool computers by making it so that instead of just having to check aaa, aab, aac, aad, and so on, they also have to check aab1, aab2, aab3. It superficially seems like adding numbers and capitals and symbols would add so much extra effort that it would be impossible, but computers can check thousands and thousands of passwords per seconds on poorly secured systems. (On hash cracking—where a hacker had downloaded a poorly encrypted list of passwords from a website, as occasionally happens even with major sites—[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/04/speed-hashing.html clever programs] can allow even just off-the-shelf computers to crack ''billions'' of hashes per second. Which means that all 6 letter passwords, even with capitals and numbers, can be cracked in ''under a minute'', and 7 letters in about an hour.)

The passwords like "12345678" are reflections of the requirement that passwords be at least 8 characters long.

Obviously, the dictionary writers had to have typeset it somehow, and computers were probably involved... but is there any way for ''me'' to replicate it? --[[User:Shay Guy|Shay Guy]] ([[User talk:Shay Guy|talk]]) 22:15, 28 June 2012 (UTC) :A "forum post" makes things a lot more tricky.  [[Kerning]] and [[typesetting]] depend on the font, application, operating system, and loads of other factors; so even if you ''found'' an appropriate set of standard unicode [[letter-spacing]] marks and an acceptable [[diacritic]] mark, it's nearly impossible to guarantee that the glyphs on ''your'' screen are similar at all to the glyphs on ''my'' screen, let alone anyone else's.  Here's a place to start: [[Phonetic_symbols_in_Unicode#Spacing_Modifier_Letters_.28U.2B02B0.E2.80.9302FF.29|Unicode phonetic symbols - spacing modifier letters]], and [[combining character]] marks.  Again, let me stress this strongly - there are about 900 million Unicode-standard-compliant ways to ''exactly'' specify the kerning you want with combining-characters and diacritics and letter glyphs, but that ''does not mean'' that people will see the correct rendering (or anything at all) on their screens.  If you ''must'' have pixel-accurate glyphs, you need to use a graphical typesetter and [[rasterize]] a bitmapped image of the typeset text. :As an example, here's a unicode "a", followed by a combined diacritic, followed by another unicode "a."   a̛a (in hex, a four-byte sequence <tt>0x61 0xCC 0x9B 0x61</tt>), which renders as two glyphs, plus an accent mark glyph, in Firefox on my operating system, reading those as UTF-8. :Here is a nice reference for many [http://www.user.uni-hannover.de/nhtcapri/combining-marks.html combining marks and precomposed equivalents].

US-based proxies work, but I do not really want to use them. Has anyone a solution that does not involve too much software (userscript in javascript would be Ok)? I may resort to writing a userscript myself but I am out of practice.

I have also looked for clues at [http://www.rankpanel.com/blog/google-search-parameters/] but that admits to only dealing with Web search too.  Here is an example: I know there are pages in ''Great economists since Keynes'' containing "Harvey Leibenstein"; I clear all cookies and start with http://www.google.com/ncr; I browse to http://books.google.com/bkshp?hl=en&tab=wp&ncr=1 which takes me to http://books.google.com/bkshp?hl=en&tab=wp&ncr=1 ; I enter the book name and click Search and get to http://www.google.com/search?q=Great+economists+since+Keynes&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 ; I add "&ncr=1&hl=en" to that URL and browse to it but when i click the first result I see google has redirected to the local domain and any search results in the local language; I also tried constructing the URL "http://books.google.com/books?id=oKG2AAAAIAAJ&q=Great+economists+since+Keynes&dq=Great+economists+since+Keynes&cd=1&ncr=1&hl=en" but Google still redirected to local.

Our website is http://www.my-compensation.co.uk - The money in this trust fund will be used for investments in order to grow it and, when it's large enough to make a difference, the funds will be donated to various charitable causes. I only own 50% of the business and so cannot state what will be done with the other half of the profits, but my half will be used mostly for charitable purposes.  I'm writing this today to request that I am allowed to post up a Wikipedia page for my business. I understand that companies are not usually allowed Wikipedia pages but I was hoping that an allowance might be made given the nature of what I will be doing with the funds.  They will go to good causes in the long-run and Wikipedia will be one of the benefactors. I'm not saying this as a bribe, it will be whether I'm allowed the page or not. I'm a donator and always will be.  Please help me in my SEO efforts with this company and allow me to have a Wikipedia page with a backlink to our site. I'll write it to the highest possible standards.  Feel free to call me on the company line if any questions.  Thank you,  Jim :Actually, lots of companies are allowed Wikipedia pages. They just have to have been properly covered by appropriate real-world sources first; see [[WP:CORP]]. I must urge you in the strongest possible way ''not'' to write an article on your own business; see [[WP:COI]]. If the necessary coverage of your company already exists, you can just let the Wikipedia community know about it. You might try adding it to [[Wikipedia:Requested articles/Business and economics/Companies]], but again, ''only'' if the sources exist.

It would be advertised on the main page, and it will be a contest to make Wikipedia the most comprehensive encyclopaedia in history.  The contest will have several different categories, inspired by the many different [[:Category:Cleanup_templates|cleanup categories]].  Examples would be things like copy editing, stub improvement, article creation, image improvement, citation improvement, article rewrite ect. Awards would be given out the largest quantity of articles improved, as well as for the best improved articles.  Editors participating in the contest will keep a running track of their article list, and at the end of the contest the community determines the who have been the most accomplished. Editors in each category will be discussed in an AfD type structure, with administrators closing the contest and awarding the editors. I imagine there not being a first, second, third type structure, but awarded like levels of participation (basic, moderate, good, excellent) with a short-list of outstanding accomplishments highlighting specific editors.  I think this would be a great way for our community to get together and share what we are doing, as well as publicly recognising our personal accomplishments. Because let's face it, editing can often be a solo endeavour, it's nice when people notice the things you've done. Most editors see improving the wiki as a reward in itself, but in order to attract that next round of editors, I think we need a bit more than just that. I think this would not only engage and recognise our most talented editors, but also entice new editors to come aboard. The future of Wikipedia depends on it's community, because without the people it's nothing. A contest like this would turn the wiki from being a collection of articles to a community of editors. --[[User:NickPenguin|<font color="darkgreen">Nick</font>]][[User talk:NickPenguin|<font color="darkblue">Penguin</font>]]<sub>([[Special:Contributions/NickPenguin|<font color="blue">'''contribs'''</font>]])</sub> 05:25, 16 August 2012 (UTC)  :Are you familiar with [[Wikipedia:Article Collaboration and Improvement Drive]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiCup]]?

How can we promote this to new users? :Maybe my specific concept of how the contest would run is not ideal. Quality is the goal, but there are some clean-up tasks that require quantity as well, and a scoring metric could be adapted to those kinds of tasks. I contend that the 'fakers' in a contest like this would be quickly spotted by the community; the people watchlisting the article will call them out on it, and they will be disqualified. I also think contestants would be easily graded, with a combination of the honour system and intuition.  :I have heard that the rate of new editors joining is lower than the rate of old editors leaving. If this is the case, something has to be done to increase the amount of quality edits that show up, and real world prizes are a strong motivator.

One of the main  concerns at  Wikipedia is that  new users are not adequately informed of what new articles should be. Proposals that  creation could be limited to autoconfirmed users were rejected. Various substituted proposals for a new landing page are under discussion  and/or development but this takes time. Many new articles have borderline notability and other important issues that require tagging but not necessarily [[WP:CSD|CSD]] or [[WP:PROD|PROD]] for deletion. More content and/or more research could probably turn them into decent articles. Many  editors and those patrolling new pages may feel that it is not the remit of regular users to complete such articles on behalf of their creators.   While (when using Twinkle) CSD and WP:PROD leave messages on the creators' talk  ages drawing their attention to issues, maintenance tags do not. Many new pages may be the creations of [[WP:SPA]] who might not return to the project and be aware of any tags,  but this does not  mean that  their articles are necessarily any less worthy of inclusion. It is possible that if new users were quickly notified while still on line that their article needs attention, we may be seeing a step towards increased user retention, and over time, a reduction in clean-up backlogs, and other areas such as [[WP:AfC|AfC]] that are snowed under.   I propose that:   '''Certain important tags such as (to  cite a few examples) COI, Unreferenced, More references required, Close paraphrasing, Essay like, Tone, Written like an ad, etc. should automatically place a welcome and a friendly notice on the new user's talk page, making them aware of work that still needs to be done, and perhaps with links to the appropriate ''specific'' guidelines.  '''  This may have been previously proposed, but as I don't immediately see anything listed at [[WP:PEREN]] this is just a suggestion that has occurred to  me during my recent intensive use of the prototype [[Special:NewPagesFeed]], and if it gains sufficient support it could be moved to [[WP:RfC|RfC]] and further discussed and perhaps developed as an additional combined feature of NewPagesFeed.

''Every single time'', no matter who you are, whether you're active, whether you actually created or care about the page, whether the tag is deserved, how old the page is, how many tags have been spammed to it today, or anything else.  You've created 60 articles over the years.  How many times do you want to be "welcomed" by a bot?  If I added one new cleanup tag—and we have some 400 or so, so I'm sure I could find one that was passably appropriate—to each one of those articles once a week, you'd get 3,120 "welcome" messages each year.  Is that what you, as a person with six years' experience and nearly 49,000 edits to your credit, really need or want?

This would suggest a simple time cut-off would prevent issues of users being told years later that someone stuck a tag on an article they've long forgotten about and maybe even dewatchlisted for lack of interest. A 30-day limit would probably be about right. The limit could also be customisable per user (eg by creating a user subpage with different settings). Other possibilities exist, including limiting notifications to "new accounts" (defined by time and/or edits; auto-confirmed limit would probably be too low), or limiting them to users who haven't logged in for a while (in the assumption that most target users will have [[Help:email notification|email notification]] turned on, so a note on their user talk page will generate an email telling them they have a new message).

Impersonal welcomes are different as they are at least friendly, but the way to deal with newbies is firstly to improve the articles they write. I'm happy with a friendly, untemplated note on someone's talkpage if after some time they are still writing like a newbie. But in my experience it is rarely necessary if you spend your time improving articles rather than templating them, as new goodfaith editors are more likely to learn by seeing their contributions improved than by having them templated. Rather than increase the amount of templating I'd suggest we try to reverse the trend to templating and encourage people to use templates less and spend more time improving articles and giving personal messages to editors.  My aim is to remove more templates than I add - maybe one day I'll create a userbox for those who do that.

With all due respect WSC, I don't  think that is accurate. A quick stint at NPP (which I know you have done plenty of) will show that a vast number of pages are created by SPA - we can see this clearly now with the meta data displayed on [[Special:NewPagesFeed]].  Now a lot of those pages are actually worth keeping, but although there are some rudimentary tasks that NPPers are ''supposed'' to do, if we expect them to stop and almost complete the articles, with  the few patrollers we have, the job of patrolling will never get done - the back  of the patrol  queue is already  at 30 days again - and the SPA will have logged out  never to return; PROD is quite a good example of this. This is not a question of 'hostile templating', but one of leaving them a friendly but semi-automated message that would encourage the creators to  do the job themselves,  and in doing so they would learn a lot more about the processes here, and then perhaps stick around and do more editing.  Take this for example: '' 'Hi xxx, welcome to  Wikipedia and thank you for creating  xxx. The article still needs your urgent attention and as you are far more familiar the subject than I am, perhaps you could return to the page and add a couple of references/include the country/add the birth place/remove the bits that were copied from another source/reword the promotional bits/etc/etc/, and if you need any help with this, don't hesitate to ask me on my talk page.''

Through my Making Meanings course at uni, I now understand how subjective language is, and how it has culture boundaries - affecting the way we see the reality around us.   This led me to the idea, which I'm sure has been brought up many-a-time, of analysing the way different langauges speak about the same topic, identifying biases, or just simply what the different Wikipedias choose to put focus on. I think some sort of investigation/research into this would be both really informative, not to mention really useful (in discovering how the socio-geo-political conditions have affected the way different culture respond to the same event).   As an example, if we had article on both UK Enlgish and US English, perhaps we would find the US article has written about America's War of Independence as a noble quest for freedom and rights, and of George Washington as a naitonal hero, and perhaps the UK article would have written the article from the perspective that the War was more of a rebellion that needed to be crushed, with George Washington being a traitor. <-- value-laden language probably has a big part in this.  So my question is: is is possible for us to get some sort of research going?

In the United States, any general election candidate for [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] is considered notable if his nominating party drew at least 30% in the previous general election cycle for that same office. A [[special election]] candidate for governor or U.S. Senator is considered notable if the candidate won a [[primary election|primary]] in that same election cycle AND his nominating party drew at least 30% in the previous general election cycle for that same office. These two or three facts must be demonstrable by reliable sources." The fact is that the ''vast majority'' of these candidates are ''already notable'', but a handful require disproportionate work to demonstrate their notability and such candidates perhaps tend to [[wikt:hail from|hail from]] areas with smaller populations and assumedly fewer Wikipedia editors. It may be that time passes for the publication of sufficient reliable sources, and additional time passes for editors to identify sources and then write the article with demonstrably [[WP:SIGCOV|significant coverage]] right from the get-go. That delay (and with an uncertain resolution) is a disservice to Wikipedia's readership, many of whom are interested in the candidates as soon as the major-party nomination is secure, and even a stub will encourage non-autoconfirmed editors to participate. In practice, the standard I propose will simply allow us to avoid delay to create articles on the [[Two-party system|two major party]] candidates (while not restricting us to those two) without well-intentioned but time-wasting interference from editors overly committed to [[WP:NOTBUREAUCRACY|bureaucracy]] and [[WP:IAR|rules]]. I believe it would be a mistake to include candidates for the U.S. House or non-governor statewide offices, as a far higher percentage of those candidates are of temporary "notability".

I readily acknowledge that I am most-familiar with the United States, but I'm open to suggestions. In the USA, each candidate for "the lower house" is elected by one of over 400 congressional districts; a particular congressional district's populace may overwhelmingly favor one political party, and so the opposition party may nominate no opponent or a merely token opponent who is unlikely to be elected or attain encyclopedic notability. So I exclude those USA House of Representatives candidates, and insist that each attain notability the old fashioned way.

Even for the U.S., I would be reluctant to agree to it as a fixed rule; I don't think we need lots of articles on failed politicians whose only content is 'so-and-so ran as the X-party candidate in Y election and lost'.

At present, we effectually favor incumbents in elections. This is not as bad as if we effectually supported one particular party, but it is similar--it is interfering with the process by which citizens find information for political purposes.

Assuming it is technically feasible, I think it would not be a bad idea to create a user permissions feature (similar to rollbackers and reviewers) which would enable users in that group to block IP vandals without actually having admin status. In my observations, blocking IP vandals is a fairly straightforward activity which does not require the kind of advanced policy knowledge that many other admin tasks do (such as deletion, for example). Yet in terms of project maintenance tasks, blocking IP vandals is probably the one that needs to be performed most frequently. Giving a limited right to block IP vandals (say for no more than 12 hours) to non-admin trusted users would alleviate persistent backlog at AIV, allow admins to concentrate on more advanced tasks and give users who later want to run for RfA some hands-on admin-related experience. I think this feature could function in a similar way to rollback rights - easily granted (by any admin) and easily taken away in case of a problem.

For example, instead of blocking certain IP users, maybe a better approach would have been to protect the article.  Maybe both IP and signed-in users are causing problems but only the IP users get blocked.  Maybe an indefinite block is warranted, and the problem resumes after 12 hours.  Also, this proposal would increase the power imbalance between IP and signed-in users, increasing the extend to which IP users are regarded as bad by default.

During nighttime in Europe this article has been moved three times by two users. None of them was a vandal, but they repeatedly made mistakes, so that at the end the Article name was wrong.

Thanks to [[User:Crisco 1492|an helpful Admin]] finally the damage could be repaired. After this experience, I wonder if it would not be a good idea to block the possibility of moving Articles as long as they stay on the main page.

In order to remain relevant in the age of online and open-access academic journals and general-interest newspapers, Wikipedia must adopt some version of editorial control. Many newly created articles are immediately tagged for speedy deletion or proposed deletion, and the ones that are not are, with few exceptions, abandoned, over the years becoming more and more outdated as nothing is added to the articles. Weeding out the obvious absurd articles is not the problem here - the issue is the broader stagnation of the encyclopedia.   To resolve the problem of short, stubby articles, I propose that all articles go through Articles for Creation, which would scrutinize all articles created by new users, and give them the "critical mass" of information required so they can lead a proper existence and not be ignored by the community. Established users in good standing (I have yet to determine a specific threshold) will not have to go through this process, as I am assuming that such users would be more diligent about their fact-checking and will have some clout with which to publicize their articles.

The results are posted, with an appropriate license release, on the review page. If an expert cannot be found who is willing to spend time on the review, for example because the area is too specialised, the requirement can be waived; only sending the request is mandatory. The point is to get as much feedback as possible on the article at a time when it is already prepared for review; experts are not expected to edit themselves. The burden of sending this request is miniscule compared to the Herculean task of writing the FAC in the first place.  For example, a featured article nomination for [[George Washington]] might solicit feedback from a historian studying American history, ideally one who has studied George Washington in particular, such as [[Frank E. Grizzard, Jr.]] or [[Edward G. Lengel]]. Even popular culture topics (such as movies, games, celebrities) would be amenable to review by scholars, critics, and journalists of pop culture.  The skills of the expert would complement the skills of Wikipedian reviewers well, with the former focusing more on correctness and completeness and the latter focusing more on complying with policies. Because the number of FACs is relatively small this is feasible and would not excessively burden scholars.

How are you going to prove, without compromising your identity, that a particular external expert has been contacted and has responded in a particular way? For "internal" Wikipedia experts verification of credentials is also basically impossible, and simply relying on self-identification of a particular user as a subject matter expert is not acceptable either, as [[Essjay controversy]] demonstrated. However, the proposal does raise some valid and traditionally ignored concerns regarding all of the existing Wikipedia mechanisms for content review (FA, GA, etc). The issue that is generally swept under the rug is that for many topics relying on [[WP:V]] is insufficient and that actual subject matter expertise and competency  are required. General knowledge topics are reasonably well-suited for the existing WP content review  procedures, but the more technical and specialized topics are not. For such topics there are often (maybe even typically) there are not enough active WP users with relevant subject matter expertise who can properly evaluate the articles on these topics. The users who actually are actively involved in the WP content review process simply lack the requisite knowledge to '''understand''' the meaning of  many statements made in articles on these topics and thus are unable to verify them even when appropriate sources are cited; and they are even less able to judge if the treatment of a particular subject is complete and well balanced. The most that one can expect from a content review in such a situation is general critique on the style of the presentation and organization of the article. Such critique is useful, but insufficient, and it is all too easy to sneak through, say, the GA process, an article that is reasonably well written but has major omissions in the way a particular topic is treated. For example, in my own subject, math, there are loads of articles on highly notable topics that should simply never be brought for GA or FA review, for the above reasons. Good examples of this are articles like [[Fundamental lemma (Langlands program)]], [[Kodaira embedding theorem]] and [[Hyperbolic Dehn surgery]]. All three deal with very important results, but, particularly for the first one, even having a PhD in Math is typically insufficient for providing a competent review of  such an article. The existing content review process operate under the assumption - a false one, in my opinion - that ''every'' WP article on a notable can, and preferably should, be brought to a GA or an FA status. But that is simply not the case. Articles on technical topics requiring considerable subject matter expertise and competence for reviewing them should simply not be nominated for GA and FA.

And if we contact multiple experts we may get multiple opposing opinions and the occasional proxy war. Experts can also be hired to back up POV editing.

Secondly, who defines an expert? This could start arguments over who is a better expert than others, and then you'll bring up [[WP:meatpuppeting|meatpuppeting]] and possibly other trickery. If someone is a good enough editor to bring an article up to FAC, they've read extensively about the subject anyway. If they want expert opinions in the relevant field, they can make the personal decision to do so, just as one would do in normal research.

So, for instance, someone who just found the new equivalent of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] could reasonably think that they are about Jesus initially, only to be overturned less than a year later. This happens in published reference works - I have no reason to think that it would not also happen here if we instituted something similar. Having said that, I do like the idea of a rather formal peer review. I have only done a few, but recently I have myself reviewed a few articles against the articles in published encyclopedia, to see if they are comparable. That won't work for [[Lady Gaga]] or similar topics which have maybe not yet been published in reference works, but it would work for a lot of articles on older topics. I wouldn't myself mind seeing a part of peer review actively indicating a step of peer review is to compare our articles against high quality recent published reference sources, but that is a rather different idea than that being proposed here.

From the perspective of a new user, it can be incredibly frustrating and tedious to have to parse through, and sometimes results in mistakes like breaking citations.  One user brought an idea across [[Special:FeedbackDashboard/46104|that it would be incredibly helpful to create a different font color in the text editor for references and regular text]]  There are certain text editors, like [[Emacs]] and [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] that can parse through text and identify keywords that indicate an expression or a function, and color them appropriately to differentiate them from other kinds of syntax.  I am unsure if this is possible to do with the current text editor we use.  I am aware of [[WP:AWB|the AutoWikiBrowser]], but I do not know if it has this functionality that I described above. So, specifically, I am proposing a change to the text editor so that certain kinds of text (e.g. <nowiki><ref> tags</nowiki>, table formatting, thumbnails, substitutions, templates) are given a different font color than text that is explicitly displayed on the page.

While the priority list would need to have its own set of preferences, all '''hide/show''' preferences for my watchlist would also apply to my priority list (let's make things easier on the devs : ) - The presumption is that while (some of us at least) may have all edited pages added to our watchlists, the priority list is for things we really wish to watch closely.

I see them as being of use to readers as well as editors (and hopefully turning readers into new editors :-)). I think it would be great if watchlists could be used as "reading lists". For example during my university degree I spent a lot of time bookmarking wikipedia articles. What I would have ''loved'' would have been a feature to 'watch' these articles, to add tags to them such as "read", "not-read". If we had such a tagging system you would get multiple watchlists (via filtering by those tags) - ie. you could invent your own tagging system such as "priority" "spam-target" etc... To reinforce this idea - when I first saw the star icon on Wikipedia article's I assumed the purpose of this feature was to favourite an article (Google Chrome my default browser uses the star for bookmarking). I then started getting e-mail notifications - and thus entered a world I hadn't expected to but was pleasantly surprised to be in - a world where I could do things like revert bad edits on articles I cared about and keep up to date on changes.[[User:Jdlrobson|Jdlrobson]] ([[User talk:Jdlrobson|talk]])  ::Another great idea.

The fact that Wikipedia can be edited by anyone is a founding principle of the encyclopedia, and I agree. Anyway there is nowadays a Wikipedia article for at least 99.9% of every bit of human knowledge: almost every city, including micro-villages, in the world has an article; all celebrities have an article; every constituent of physical matter in every form, known and theoretical, has an article; even the most obscure philosophical concepts have an article. The point is, at least 50% of all new articles created is deleted within a week if not immediately by CSD; another 30% is non-notable, orphaned and unreferenced and stays like that thereafter. I assume the remaining 20% is suitable content for an encyclopedia. The problem is that most of editor and admin resources are wasted fixing the problems caused by that 80% bad articles that are created everyday. More and more people get access to the internet in the emerging regions of the planet such as India, North Africa, the Middle East and China. This is great news for freedom and democracy, but it also entails the problem that some of these guys (and even a small percentage means thousands of people each day) want to edit the 6th most popular website in the world, and most of the time they do it just to get in the spotlight, because they have a conflict of interest, for religious propaganda (especially fanaticism-prone Islam), because they are paid to advertise, or just for (disruptive) fun. Jimbo Wales has complained that [http://gawker.com/5827835/ Wikipedia is slowly dying]; maybe because it is becoming too messy and/or large to manage for dedicated editors? '''The best solution to all of this would be preventing non-confirmed users to create new articles. IPs would still be able to submit drafts for new articles, but these would not be immediately published; instead they would remain suspended to be reviewed by new page patrollers, before getting a red or green light for publication.''' This would be a fantastic deterrent against the creation of unwanted material because the anonymous editor now knows that his article will not go immediately online but would be subject to review - hoaxes, unreferenced biographies, advertisements, non-notable and unsourced content would have zero chance of being published on Wikipedia. One could argue that new user creation is a matter of a few seconds. That is right, but is still a further step one has to take before being able to create articles; in the meantime they could change their mind;  requiring email confirmation to register new accounts would be the final nail in the coffin against unwanted content. A lot of resources would then be freed to counter vandalism and to relieve the backlog. The ''anyone can edit (and create)'' concept made a lot of sense while Wikipedia was in its infancy and needed to grow. To prevent Wikipedia from becoming an utter mess, stripping that concept of the ''create'' part would make a lot of sense in 2013.--<span style="text-shadow:#333333 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em;">[[User:Itemirus|Itemirus]]</span>[[User talk:Itemirus|<font color="green"> <small>(talk) </small></font>]] 14:01, 4 September 2012 (UTC) *It's more than just a perennial proposal, see [[WP:ACTRIAL]].

Lets be honest, if you don't know what the Teahouse is, you probably aren't going to search for it. Additionally, with our new search filters to prevent Google from displaying non article stuff, in order to find them accurately you have to search for them by Namespace and a lot of folks won't know that.

If that lands me at [[Help:Contents]], then in all honesty, I think I'd get lost. So instead of adding more information (By adding a link to every page), consider creating better user guidance behind the current targets. So perhaps we should change the Help link in the side bar to point to a new help system that is better at getting people where they need to be, instead of dumping them in the index of an incomplete and confusing book.

It defeats their purpose. If we are going to be worried about making more work for ourselves then we shouldn't even start. It defeats the purpose of the pedia IMO.

Out of 4 million pages on Wikipedia, a significant percentage of them is in a miserable condition, are abandoned or not visited for a long time. As of today, there are more than 170,000 orphaned pages, 55,000 are tagged as non notable, more than 230,000 are tagged as unreferenced and 250,000  poorly referenced, including BLPs. Some of these pages are tagged like that since 2006 ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Orphaned_articles_from_November_2006 there are more than 2000 orphaned pages tagged since november 2006]).  The idea is to have Wikipedia automatically tag pages that satisfy a set of conditions - e.g. number of significant edits in the last 6 months (excluding bots) < 5 AND page accessed in the last 6 months < 20 times (from different IPs) - as '''semi-deleted''' ; the page would then be not accessible except for admins and a special group or reviewers (or a WikiProject) which will then decide the destiny of the page (merge or delete) without further discussion needed; alternatively (or in addition) another set of more severe rules would have Wikipedia automatically delete the page. Check for example the history of [[L-EXOS]]; the article has not been edited for more than 17 months, is still orphaned and since its creation in 2005 there have been no significant edits. You guess how many times it has been visited since. This would bypass the deletion discussion and would be an automated process helping keep Wikipedia much cleaner and make the backlog much more useful. --<span style="text-shadow:#333333 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em;">[[User:Itemirus|Itemirus]]</span>[[User talk:Itemirus|<font color="green"> <small>(talk) </small></font>]] 14:39, 3 September 2012 (UTC) :Isn't this the difference between "published" vs "unpublished" state ? —[[User:TheDJ|Th<span style="color: green">e</span>DJ]] ([[User talk:TheDJ|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheDJ|contribs]]) 15:33, 3 September 2012 (UTC) ::I miss your point.

You could keep the last year, 3 months, or 6 months TOC trail on the talk page. After that period of time, move the old TOC trail index to a consolidation page. Keep moving the TOC trail to that one page. Then you end up with one TOC index on one page. That would be very useful.   Currently, busy talk pages such as Village Pumps have huge archives spread out over many pages. The only way to find anything is with an archive search tool. It would be nice to be able to scan the topics, too. If I am looking to see what the topics of discussion have been for the last year or 6 months this would be very convenient.   Look at [[meta:Wikimedia Foundation Report, July 2012]] and the archive index by month and year to the right. That collapsible index format could be adapted to a TOC trail consolidated to one page.   Helder might be interested in all this as another way to index the Portuguese Wikipedia Village Pumps. It currently indexes using monthly and yearly categories.

They may very well assume it to be 'another' DYK that just got picked out from the bunch. * It certainly was a huge shock to me when I found out that you could have articles at 'featured article status' that had never been featured on the main page - because FA is actually a level of article quality, not a symbol of being featured on the main page * [If I am wrong up to this point, please let me know. This is what I understand after some investigation into the matter] * So, I suggest we rename the featured article status to, for example, "great article" or "excellent article", or "best article" or something like that to then make it obvious that we are talking about levels of quality here. * Then when the star is added, it is simply a badge of honour to recognise that the article has also been featured on the main page at least once throughout its lifetime. * One consequence of this decision would be that [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates]] will be renamed to '''Wikipedia:________ article candidates'''. {{strike|Perhaps a new forum, specifically designed for setting up a calender for '''FAs of the day''' can be set up.

One project may rate a article B-class for decent coverage of content related to the project topic, while another project may consider it C or start for minimal coverage of its project topic (not all projects use C ratings, which were a later addition). It's not uncommon for one aspect of a topic to be better covered than other aspects, leading to different project ratings. FA and GA are not reviews within a topic area, so reflect somewhat broader reviews of overall content, writing, image use, and so on.

That just means it's a Good Article that is no longer at GA-Class, again that's possible because GA status and GA-Class are technically distinct. (see below). :::The Stub-Class is an analog to the stub-sorting project, and typically it's reserved for short or unorganized articles. Start-Class is the next level up in terms of content and organization; I liken it to being the start of a decent article. That's followed by C, B, GA-Class (technically distinct from GA), A-Class and FA-Class (also technically distinct from FA). A project doesn't have to award GA-Class to an article listed as a GA; in fact USRD has had a few examples where a GA failed to meet the project's B-Class criteria, even though it was awarded GA status, so the article would have been both a C-Class and a GA before they were improved. <span style="background:#006B54; padding:2px;">'''[[User:Imzadi1979|<font color="white">Imzadi&nbsp;1979</font>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Imzadi1979|<font color="white"><big>→</big></font>]]'''</span>  22:24, 20 August 2012 (UTC) ::::Huhhhhh..... wow...

(like a fly buzzing passed your face that you have to swat away --> little effort + frequent = very annoying). If the title can be changed once, it surely can be changed again. I want to know why the title got changed from "brilliant prose" to "featured article" int he first place.

Perhaps in the past one sentence articles would suffice as stubs, but nowadays they get deleted within an instant (I disagree with this sentiment, but, wadaya gonna do..). Nowadays, what you describe as a start article, I would liken much more to a stub article - the only way a stub article can survive [[Special:Newpages]] is for it to be what would've passed for a start-class article 6 years ago. Perhaps start-class is obsolete. Perhaps it is misnamed. We need to realise that these traditions have stayed here for so long while time has moved on. Technology has moved on. And most importantly, WE have moved on. We need to change the structure of our site to keep up with the way Wikipedia works in 2012.--[[User:Coin945|Coin945]] ([[User talk:Coin945|talk]]) 15:08, 21 August 2012 (UTC) :::::I don't find it confusing that GA status and GA-Class assessment are separate. One is a status awarded by a community-based review process, and the other is a WikiProject-level assessment. Take, for example, a hypothetical article on a highway in Wisconsin. It's tagged by the USRD project and the Wisconsin project. Let's assume that someone took it to GAN, and it passed. Now it's a Good Article and it's been reassessed as GA-Class because both projects make that status equivalent to that assessment. OK, now the article is reviewed at ACR for USRD and promoted. Because the Wisconsin project wouldn't necessarily have to honor our ACR, the article would be A-Class for USRD and GA-Class for WI, but it's still listed on WP:GA because it's still a Good Article. A-Class doesn't change the little green icon on the article, nor does it remove the article from the WP:GA list. :::::For another example, [[Prairie Avenue]] would have once been tagged for USRD before the US Streets project was formed. (USRD deals with state highways, not city streets). It's a FA, but if it were still tagged for USRD, it would fall as a Start-Class article on our assessment scheme. (It's missing a junction list, which USRD requires in addition to a route description and a history section for C- or B-Class assessments.) The assessment classes are distinct from any status awarded through the community review processes. <span style="background:#006B54; padding:2px;">'''[[User:Imzadi1979|<font color="white">Imzadi&nbsp;1979</font>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Imzadi1979|<font color="white"><big>→</big></font>]]'''</span>  22:22, 21 August 2012 (UTC) :::::: I'm sorry, what you have just described is actually very confusing and counter-intuitive to me.

If you have a featured article that is stil considered a start-class article in the USRD rating system, what that says to me is that the article doesn't have all it's supposed to have after all, and that the article should lose its FA status. An FA article should have addressed all the FA criteria for the various Wikiprojects that make it up.

A Good Article ''usually'' means GA-Class, and a Featured Article ''usually'' means FA-Class but there will be exceptions. WP:MILHIST once assessed its Featured Lists as FA-Class because the project didn't use FL-Class. Yes, the classes ''usually'' line up with the community ratings from GA/FA/FL, but there is no requirement that they do so. Some projects use non-standard classes, there is a B+ rating in use by some projects that's above B-Class, and MILHIST has CL-, BL- and AL-Class for lists. (See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment]].) Featured Pictures and Featured Sounds can be assessed as FM-Class (Featured Media) instead of just File-Class for projects that care to make the distinction, but some projects don't assess files at all.

There's always *some* minimal content to: "here's a non-exhaustive  list of topics that the reader is assumed to be familiar with before reading this". Furthermore, a work-in-progress prerequisites tree (like a Debian dependency tree) would be of great encyclopedic value itself.  Again, I am aware how difficult this can be; it's not like I can't find tens of arguments against it myself. I just think there are some solid reasons to give it some thought. Perhaps fewer and less solid than the reasons to do nothing, but that's just normal for a concept that many people may have not even thought about. So perhaps if we gave it a chance...

Another option, to help focus on fixing major issues, might be to have a frequent report, as with "Days since Edit-conflicts still not fixed". In this case, I am thinking about the type of edit-conflicts where editing a bottom section, to add another new section, should be considered an automatic correction, and so we could count the days since that bottom-section problem has not been fixed. However, how far back should the count extend? Perhaps start one year ago, or what date would more fairly reflect how long people have wanted the edit-conflicts to be fixed. Also, which template(s) should be used to show the elapsed time. Perhaps a years+days counter would be better, such as: :::::: "4 years, 257 days, and edit-conflicts still not fixed" That seems better than showing thousands of days. Then, we could show the not-yet-fixed counters in pages about edit-conflict issues.

I guess not many people realize that section-based edits are already retro-inserted into previously-edited pages, to avoid edit-conflicts (not "inevitable") even though the prior page is in true conflict with the next revision generated. It does not take much additional logic to treat portions of text as similar to section-editing, or the unchanged end-section text as an implicit new-section edit (any person who appends to end-section 'n' unchanged, is creating ''implicit'' new section 'n2' or 'n3' when conflict). Another issue, which makes many edit-conflicts seem hopeless is the current text-differencing algorithm which becomes confused by a line deletion or insertion. Instead, an edit-conflict can be auto-corrected by re-syncing on the prefix/suffix sections of other lines, rather than just the complete match against ''whole lines'' (ignoring the power of prefix/suffix matches). By that method, many partially-changed lines can be recognized as equivalent to the prior unchanged lines, and even some interleaved changes to every other line could be re-synced during an edit-merge, as in User:A changes lines 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, meanwhile User:B changes lines 1, 3, 5 (etc.), but inserts new lines, and the result is: "Auto-corrected edit-conflict, no difficulty at all". The 3 versions would be merely line-for-line recombined, treating the current saved version as the base, and then treating the differences against the prior version as the new text (skip lines 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.). In complex cases, the merge could be reported as "too extensive" to autofix. I know when this is implemented, the developers will be accused of "[[black magic]]" and watched suspiciously for their "alien powers" of advanced technology to solve the impossible edit-conflicts, but I think we could even explain the process to new users, as to how the partially changed lines are spotted as being re-sync points which allow the amazing auto-correction of numerous wannable edit-conflicts. I promise you, this will be awesome fun, as the finest wizardry, for the developers who agree to update the software to auto-correct these easy-to-merge conflicts (as a 3-revision synchronization). In fact, we could even have a user-preference: "Accept auto-corrected edit-conflicts as edit-save" to make it seem there are almost no edit-conflicts to busy editors. I think the imagined difficulty comes from text-book examples with short-line text, but because our editors create such ''ultra-long lines'' of text, then the re-sync of numerous changes can be easier to spot by prefix/suffix matches than in short-line, text-book cases. Another issue, but rare, is lookahead of several lines to re-sync, as in repeated groups of similar test-data lines. I have studied these issues for many years, so that is why I knew the many secrets. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 22:03, 18 May 2013 (UTC)  ::Who are you preaching to ?

So, I apologize for the misunderstandings. The next fix would be for 2 replies added after the same line, in a talk-page, or a list (etc.). However, the editor community needs to reach a consensus, so the developers would have a resolution, to append a 2nd reply, after the 1st reply, at the same line number, which is currently treated as "edit-conflict" and extremely common in fast-moving talk-pages. The developers have already finished "90%" of the bigger, complex Edit-merge operations, and what is left is to decide the community's choice as to which order to append two replies at the same line number.

So some options: ::* <nowiki><code style="background: yellow; color: dimgray;">A B C <code style="background: pink; color: darkgreen;">D</code></code></nowiki> &rarr; <code style="background: yellow; color: dimgray;">A B C <code style="background: pink; color: darkgreen;">D</code></code> ::* <nowiki><code style="background: yellow; color: dimgray;">A B C <span/></code><code style="background: pink; color: darkgreen;">D</code></nowiki> &rarr; <code style="background: yellow; color: dimgray;">A B C <span/></code><code style="background: pink; color: darkgreen;">D</code> : If the text wrapped after "C" then the trailing space would still appear at the end-of-line, with the next line having letter "D". Although the request was to note/fix the bug, due to restrictions of HTML Tidy, then other editors need to realize how a nested-tag or null span-tag "&lt;span/&gt;" must be used to preserve the trailing-space color inside the outer tag.

Crosswiki watchlists ([[bugzilla:3525]]) are still a way off. But I'm wondering how difficult it would be to hack up something in the meantime using a JavaScript gadget.  Here's the basic idea: a user would go to [[Special:Watchlist]] on his or her home wiki and at the top there would be a prominent drop-down menu that defaults to the user's current wiki (e.g., "en.wikipedia.org"). The drop-down menu would be configured on a per-user basis to list other wikis (e.g., "meta.wikimedia.org" and "test.wikipedia.org").  If the user selects one of these domains in the drop-down menu, the watchlist content would reload (staying on the same domain and hopefully not requiring any browser window refresh). Ajax would be used to pull watchlist content via the MediaWiki API from remote wikis. Watchlists already have support for external tools pulling their contents via a watchlist token.  Here's where I'm having difficulty mapping out this feature in my head:  # How would you store which wikis to feature in the drop-down menu on a per-user basis? We don't want to list all possible wikis as the list is simply overwhelming and most users just want to keep an eye on one or two other wikis. # How would you store the watchlist token on a per-user basis in a place that's both configurable, but still allows the user to keep the token private?  Between cookies, local storage, JavaScript obfuscation, and possibly the action=options MediaWiki API module, I feel like figuring how to store this information in a persistent, yet private, way should be possible.

We need to focus on having an Edit-merge dialog to autocorrect for simple edit-conflicts. I wrote essay "[[wp:Avoiding edit-conflicts]]" to explain how to proofread, then simply re-edit, and tediously copy/paste before SAVE, to reduce edit-conflicts, but some autocorrection could be done as well. For years, we have wanted the edit-conflicts to be fixed, especially for simple cases, such as a new thread appended at bottom, inserting a short reply, or changing a few words in the non-edited paragraphs. Because any intervening change can ''profoundly'' alter the meaning of the edit-conflict text (such as someone inserting the word "not"), then the Edit-merge dialog would be yet another edit-preview requiring active approval, but with new text retro-inserted into the latest, prior revision of a page, for further proofreading. Then, the editor (handling the Edit-merge) decides whether to hit SAVE or rewrite the edit-merged text, as perhaps to respond otherwise to the recent interleaved changes. What is the status of developer updates to directly auto-correct and merge the edit-conflict problems? Does anyone think retro-inserting the reply text, at the same relative points would not work well enough in most cases? This has been a high-priority problem, especially when working on new hot-topic articles, where inserting a short phrase+footnote often gets an edit-conflict for some other erstwhile modified paragraph, even within a section-edit change. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 05:19, 17 May 2013 (UTC) * '''Edit-merge works for separate portions but 2-reply conflict needs FIFO consensus:''' Extensive auto-correction for many edit-conflicts has existed since 2004, when re-combining separate parts of a page, such as the 1st editor changes the infobox parameters, while 2nd editor changes a later paragraph, and the 2nd editor's paragraph is inserted with the 1st editor's infobox. The next fix would be for 2 replies added after the same line, in a talk-page, or a list (etc.). However, the editor community needs to reach a consensus, so the developers would have a resolution, to append a 2nd reply, after the 1st reply, at the same line number, which is currently treated as "edit-conflict" and extremely common in fast-moving talk-pages. I suggest to use [[FIFO]] order (first-in, first-out), so the 1st reply takes precedence over the 2nd reply, to be inserted after the 1st. The developers have already finished "90%" of the bigger, complex Edit-merge operations, and what is left is to decide the community's choice as to which order to append two replies at the same line number, such as FIFO order. Perhaps we need an RfC to decide that issue. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 10:54, 21 May 2013 (UTC) *:Too much editor discretion is involved in merging that type of conflict for it to be automated. One might choose to place the 2nd comment after the 1st, to maintain chronological order. However, if the 2nd comment is in reply to something particular, while the 1st is a reply to the whole thread, the author of the 2nd comment might choose to place it before the 1st. The 2nd commenter might choose to abort their edit if the 1st commenter said pretty much the same thing they did. They might also want to change the indentation of their comment or even the content, to be more consistent with the first editor. *:Basically, the 2nd commenter needs to answer the question "what would you have done if the 1st comment was there when you started to comment?". The software can't answer that without additional input from the 2nd commenter. *:Also consider that the same edit conflict resolution algorithm is used on articles&#160;– if two people try to insert a paragraph at the same position in an article, it needs a human to arrange and/or re-edit the text so that it flows smoothly from one paragraph to the next. *:Your current concerns seem mainly about talk pages, so the developers probably won't have much interest in changing this&#160;– they want to replace wiki-style talk pages with [[mw:Flow|Flow]]. Since each comment is kept separately in Flow, it isn't possible for one comment to conflict with another (the same was true of [[mw:Extension:LiquidThreads|LiquidThreads]], but the WMF killed that project). *:I think the main development work needed for edit conflict handling is to make the UI friendlier and easier to use. Some examples: a) Only show the sections of the page that are in conflict, rather than the full wikitext of the page. b) If an edit affected multiple parts of the page, automatically merge those parts that did not conflict rather than forcing the user to manually merge all of it. c) A single edit box with SVN-style conflict markers. (The wiki software could reject attempts to save if the conflict markers weren't removed from the text. This would also make it harder for someone to copy the text of their edit over the current text without merging the changes.) – '''[[User:PartTimeGnome|PartTimeGnome]]''' <span style="font-size:79%;">([[User talk:PartTimeGnome|talk]]&#160;&#124; [[Special:Contributions/PartTimeGnome|contribs]])</span> 22:36, 23 May 2013 (UTC) * '''Stopping the edit-conflict to give 2nd user power to choose is illusion:''' I know it might seem there are many decisions for the 2nd editor's reply, as to rethink the placement, to rethink the wording, or to consider the 1st editor's reply was enough, but that level of control is just an "illusion of control" and the 1st editor (or anyone) could re-edit to shift comments, or hat-hide sections, to overpower the careful edit-conflict resolution of a 2nd editor. The same would happen in articles, when the 2nd editor added a line or sentence, at the same point, where the 1st editor's text was added. In a general sense, the edit-conflict halt is a heightened case of multiple people working on the same page, but focused on the same consecutive lines. The general problem is: ::::::* '''Edition-confliction:'''&nbsp; Some other people might change what you wrote,<br>please reconsider editing this page next month, next year or never again. : However, the fatal edit-conflicts at consecutive lines are an interesting narrow, rabid focus on 2 editors changing nearby lines, as if it were an end-of-the-world crisis decision, ''"Aaarrgghh!

Oh no, Oh no, what to do? what to do? how could life go on if your text was inserted after the 1st editor's text rather than before it, OMG, call for help, sound the alarm, OMG, OMG, Oh-My-friggin-GAAWWDD!"''&nbsp; I had not realized that edit-conflicts were actually such an exaggeration of the critical impending dangers of 2 editors inserting text at the same line, as yet another ''DramaQueenapedia'' blowup over what should be just, "2nd editor's text is inserted following 1st editor's text" (simple as that). However, I can understand how the exaggerated fear of consecutive lines has allowed the edit-conflicts to remain all these years, but it is past time to just simply combine the edits of the 2 editors, where the 2nd editor follows the 1st text. When that is fixed for talk-pages, then the same fix would apply in articles, where the 2nd editor's new sentence would append after the 1st editor's text inserted, or a 3rd editor might decide to rearrange the text added by both editors. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 01:16, 24 May 2013 (UTC) ::The ability of others to later edit what I write has nothing to do with edit conflict resolution.

The problem of removing the prior edit ({{diff|Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)|next|556595557|dif-557}}), to wp:PUMPTECH page, seems to follow a pattern where an edit-conflict should have been edit-merged with previous revision (within 2 minutes earlier) but was incorrectly "auto-removed" when storing the next edit. Although I know we should not talk much about non-WMF wikis here (as red herrings), I found reports from July 2012 of other [[MediaWiki]]-based wikis with similar overwrites within 2-minute interval, and I concluded perhaps it was not a local developer-related bug but perhaps inherent in recent MediaWiki software. That's a lot of "perhaps" but it is another good reason to fix simple edit-conflicts, as a chance to rework edit-conflict algorithms which have prior bugs, and also auto-append a new "==header==" conflict-edited into the end section of an article/talk-page. Again, developers have asked people to scope the consensus to work on edit-conflict problems, else not a priority for them. As a tangent, I will note sometimes it is easier to extend software, with new algorithms, rather than "fix a prior bug" directly, because the new algorithm might bypass the bug or else handle more cases where the bug fix would have been hindered by the older algorithm. So then here is the crux: to resolve 2 additions/deletions at same line number, then developers need decision, such as [[FIFO]] (first-in, first-out) where 1st editor appends at line, but 2nd editor appends after 1st, as the automatic (rapid) way to resolve the common 2-replies, or 2-additions, edit-conflict.

[[bugzilla:26547]] suggested to ignore "display:none" in DISPLAYTITLE. Copy-pasting the displayed title of [[Kalai's 3^d conjecture]] gives [[Kalai's 3d conjecture]] which at least redirects to the right article, but it will look bad if people make a copy-pasted link saying [[Kalai's 3d conjecture]] in other articles. 3d and 3^d have completely different meanings.

The mind boggles, as with cars which auto-lock the doors if started with door open, driver steps out to get package, and the door autolocks with engine running.

In the two weeks since 1.22wmf4, the team attended the [[mw:Amsterdam Hackathon 2013|Wikimania Hackathon in Amsterdam]], working with the community to improve VisualEditor and help them, and, ahead of VisualEditor's launch as the default way users will edit our wikis in beta, worked on the new features: Categories, Templates, References and Images.  In terms of improvements to the integration with MediaWiki, we have a number of changes. When the diff result is null because we think you've made no changes, we say so rather than give a confusing blank diff table ([[bugzilla:43754|43754]]); wikitext edit conflict handling is now integrated into the save dialog rather than punting you out of VisualEditor ([[bugzilla:42522|42522]]); minor edit checkboxes get pre-set ([[bugzilla:48347|48347]]), and you get a warning about not having set an edit summary ([[bugzilla:47752|47752]]), based on your preferences; when editing old revisions, you are now warned about this ([[bugzilla:47683|47683]]); we now show "Editing …" in the browser title when in VisualEditor, like for the wikitext editor, so that it's clear which of your tabs is editing ([[bugzilla:48272|48272]]).  We give a better error message if Parsoid is unavailable during diffs ([[bugzilla:47581|47581]]). If the edit token we're using is detected as invalid, we ask for a new one ([[bugzilla:42984|42984]]). The edit summary field correctly counts the number of characters entered when using non-ASCII characters ([[bugzilla:47718|47718]]). The <''visualeditor-feedback-link''> message is now shown in the content language, rather than the user language ([[bugzilla:47730|47730]]). We now won't load for pages which are redirects as they can't yet be edited ([[bugzilla:47329|47329]]). We show "create source" rather than "edit source" for the wikitext editor tab for non-existent pages ([[bugzilla:47421|47421]]). We don't disable the save dialog when editing a prior revision ([[bugzilla:48584|48584]]). Pre-formatted text blocks now word-wrap rather than character-wrap ([[bugzilla:38043|38043]]).  Auto-selection expansion now behaves at the ends of paragraphs as elsewhere ([[bugzilla:48487|48487]]), and the link inspector now understands that the first characters of links being auto-capitalised based on wiki context doesn't make them different links ([[bugzilla:48476|48476]]). The toolbar clears floated items to avoid mis-alignment ([[bugzilla:48734|48734]]). VisualEditor should now work with non-BMP Unicode characters ([[bugzilla:48630|48630]]). Finally, we fixed a couple of breaks in the link inspector button ([[bugzilla:48509|48509]] and [[bugzilla:48549|48549]]), in pasting text ([[bugzilla:48602|48602]] and [[bugzilla:48603|48603]]), and some problems when moving back to read mode whilst VisualEditor was loading ([[bugzilla:48520|48520]] and [[bugzilla:47813|47813]]).

However, accurate categories are important, and so the tactic of using a null-edit bot to "knock some sense" into the MediaWiki database links is a reasonable option. In this age, of layer upon layer of software modules, it is becoming nearly impossible to keep pace with problems; however, the potential for "crowd-sourcing" or "expert-group-sourcing" might resolve problems faster, as more people work together to solve vast numbers of software problems. In fact, it might make sense to have "null-edit backlog drives" to encourage hundreds of editors to help correct category links in some high-priority categories, perhaps in articles about medical treatments or such. However, the future seems clear to me: "Everyone worry about performance" (versus the archaic [[wp:PERF]]), and together perhaps we can quickly find the causes of the massive software bugs in the Wikipedia software or else, help to manually (or Bot-wise) circumvent the problems to lessen their impact. Perhaps some day we might look back on the list of "Top 20 appalling MediaWiki software problems" and remember why it took so long to fix some of them. But keep looking for solutions. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 21:54, 24 May 2013 (UTC) ::"Everyone worry about performance"? [[WP:Don't worry about performance|WP:PERF]] says some very wise things. Though you know of it, you don't understand all of it, particularly the "[[WP:Don't worry about performance#Editors still have a role to play|Editors still have a role to play]]" section. The main point of the page is worries about server performance are not a reason to avoid useful edits ([[WP:Be bold|Be bold]], etc). Where a performance problem becomes visible to users, ''technically-minded'' editors can find ways to make improvements (e.g. rewriting a slow template using Lua). "Everyone worry" would mean non-technical users being afraid to make edits if they are unsure of the performance impact, or taking actions based on superstitions about performance rather than a good understanding of it. Such actions could waste their time and that of others and make articles harder to maintain, with probably no effect on performance. ::Though editors can improve performance in isolated areas such as problematic templates, we don't have access to the servers for making site-wide improvements. Hence, most performance issues are only for developers to worry about, since they are the only ones able to fix them.

There is also a major problem of staleness, here already, of topics which experts could see to move to a tech-extra forum (such as tricks to bypass this month's "13" user-interface changes). Plus, having some topics sitting for weeks in a tech-extra page would help the "retro-analysis" of issues, to rethink plans from prior weeks, and perhaps to post links to the specific follow-up templates, help-pages, gadgets (etc.) which now make sense, in retrospect about a topic weeks ago. Next, there is also the opportunity to reduce obvious bloat here, to move some threads to tech-extra sooner, and also append to related long-term threads already in that page. Then the moved topics could be pre-archived, perhaps with a dedicted thread here, "Topics moved to tech-extra May 2013" with one-line links to short titles of the tech-extra topics. Finally, by quickly moving extensive discussions to the tech-extra page, then the archives there would become more comprehensive of full discussions, not fractionated bits and pieces rushed in spurts into the main PUMPTECH archives. The overall concept, for the extra page, would function as a form of "discussable archive" (as people noted above) where the history-log of edits would reflect actual long-term discussions. People could reply, ''"I'll answer over at tech-extra, with direct links to related issues"''. Hopefully, a tech-extra page would surpass as a re-arrangeable "[[wp:Liquid Threads]]" with methods to restructure long-term discussions of issues which spanned months (plus <s>strike</s> bars in old misleading comments), while streamlining the main VPT page and reducing the rushed archives.

Previously, all of the edits that came via that interface were tagged, even if you weren't really new.   Considering that most of the edits already do come from genuinely new editors, I don't think the volume level will change for the tag significantly.

At the bottom, via {{tl|Authority control}}, it is connected to [http://d-nb.info/gnd/118576488 this GND/DNB profile] (DNB as in [[Deutsche Nationalbibliothek]]). As you can see, the DNB profile lists a couple of dozens of alternative spellings of Maimonides' name. So I was thinking how great it would be if the Wikipedia software would automatically extract these name variants and create redirects to the actual article (not just to [[Maimonides]], of course, but to all [[:Category:Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers|Wikipedia articles with GND identifiers]]). The data is also available in [http://d-nb.info/118576488/about/rdf RDF format], so machine readability shouldn't be an issue here (again I'm not a programmer).  Is it possible to do this? Because it would save Wikipedia editors a lot of time and energy not having to create all those redirects manually. --[[User:Bender235|bender235]] ([[User talk:Bender235|talk]]) 16:52, 24 May 2013 (UTC) * '''Sourced variant names are interesting but WP overrun by variants:''' That suggestion, to use the [[Deutsche Nationalbibliothek]] profiles (or other) to generate redirect titles is an interesting idea, but there are just too many thousands (over 280 thousand?) of redirects, and we need to restrict (remove) to only have the high-use variants. The best place to list numerous variant spellings is within an article's footnotes, and then a wikisearch (Search:[______]) for those rare spellings would match to whichever articles contained them. Meanwhile, we really need a Bot to sift through over 280 thousand current redirects as "improbable redirects" to delete them. For example, a variant of "[[New York]]" might include "[[Newe Yorke]]" as a reasonable spelling, as stylized from the archaic word "newe" used in other town names; however, some/many people have gone wild and created zillions of bizarre redirects, in the style of "Nuew Yorkke" or "Nue Yorrk" or "Nu.YoRK." or even "N.w Y.rK" or similar bizarro redirects (the mind boggles, see: 65,500 titles in "[[:Category:Redirects from alternative names]]"). So, in a sane world, then auto-creating historical variant spellings would make sense, but WP is currently overrun, overwhelmed with "redirect hoarding" of certainly many thousands of useless redirects, often many variations of corporation names.

This depends upon some javascript being retrieved from [[//bits.wikimedia.org/ Wikimedia's "bits" servers]. Several things can stop these links from being clickable: (i) your browser doesn't support javascript; (ii) it does support javascript but it's been disabled; (iii) you have a slow network or slow internet; (iv) the Wikimedia bits servers are slow. Of these, the first two are unlikely, given what you've already stated about it working sometimes. The other two have a similar effect: after a period, your browser "times out" - it gives up waiting for all of the javascript, and displays the fallback "Copy and paste" text instead. I'd try to establish that you do have a good connection, and if so, blame the Wikimedia servers. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 08:50, 31 May 2013 (UTC) ::::Between iii and iv, I'd add "The connection between you and Wikipedia is bad".

It might be that your ISP or your home router is using some sort of proxy caching that is operating faulty. I'm not sure where you are located, but in many areas of the world ISPs do a lot of caching to speed up your internet connection and to save bandwidth for themselves. If this caching is a tad lazy (inherently making it broken), it might be serving you 'stale' pages. Pages/scripts that are outdated and really should be fetched from Wikipedia again (because they would have different contents), but instead you are getting from a cache somewhere. This should not happen, it's a bug, but not one you (or Wikipedia) can do a lot about (the helpdesk will loose you after the first sentence). Usually these pages are cached for about 30 days maximum, and then it's should clear up. If you really want to know, then you need to do problem reduction. Try your computer at someone's house with the same ISP, try at someone with a different ISP, try changing your router brand etc. you need to separate all potential problem areas, and reduce the 'surface' of where the problems occur. That way you could reduce it to a pc, a router, your isp, your region etc. Remember that ISPs often have multiple brands, take that into account as well. Its cumbersome work and not what you want to hear, but there is not much that other editors can do to help you. I've checked your account, and you are not running any custom scripts. There haven't been reports about malfunctioning gadgets (at least none that aren't resolved). However there was a big breakage in the gadgets and scripts last week. If your ISP is caching the broken state of one of those scripts, it might explain why you cannot get it fixed. —[[User:TheDJ|Th<span style="color: green">e</span>DJ]] ([[User talk:TheDJ|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheDJ|contribs]]) 12:12, 2 June 2013 (UTC)  * '''English WP website has descended into total chaos of bizarre changes:''' During May 2013, the [[MediaWiki]] software has been changed, every few days, to add new features, and drop others, such as the orange new-messages bar.

This is not, to my knowledge, something that has been replicated anywhere else - of our half-billion users and N thousand editors, you are the only one who has come up with the problem, which is something that, as TheDJ has pointed out above, can be explained by many factors that have nothing to do with the servers.

''[[Iff]]'' it is a problem at the server end (and if it was, again, you'd expect other people to notice or report it), the people who would fix it are almost certainly nothing to do with the teams working on Echo or any of the other projects you're also taking issue with.

You also were involved in the new notification system (ECHO) that was introduced with many bugs and little to no input from regular editors who don't pay much attention to such, (when editors do have problems with changes they might not care enough or simply don't know  where to comment, so the number of affected users is of course way higher than can be seen.) The RFC regarding the forced upon change made the change to a small orange bar happen and after several complains of bugs in the system they were fixed after some time. Something that shouldn't have happened as the new feauture should've be inplemented only after making sure there are no (big) bugs left and some short trials, (besides better communication with the community if and what they really want.)<br>You say you're "''annoyed''" and "''...find [my] attitude - to instinctively blame the WMF when anything goes wrong - to be problematic''".

[[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]] ([[User talk:Technical 13|talk]]) 12:19, 2 June 2013 (UTC)  == How to run a query about user contributions - help needed ==  I am intending to carry out a research following the [http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Former_Contributors_Survey_Results 2011 Former Contributors Survey Results] (WMF is aware and supportive of this project, which we hope will provide WMF and the community with useful information about editor retention; and I am a Wikipedia studies scholar with [http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gdV8_AEAAAAJ&hl=en a track record] of peer reviewed publications). A major part of this project involves studying the contribution patterns of most active editors; I am in particular interested if there is a correlation between contribution to certain namespaces/pages within them and editors becoming less active and/or leaving our project altogether.  However, doing this using the [[Special:Contribs]] is ''painful'', verging on impossible due to being way too time consuming, particularly with the requests timing out 9 times out of 10 (and I am trying to create a dataset for edits of 1,000 or so editors). None of the tools listed at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters]] which I have used in the past have the functionality or speed I require.  At the same time I am pretty sure this can be done by individuals who have the voodoo knowledge required to use [[Wikipedia:Database queries]]; unfortunately I am not capable of doing so. To be honest, I am not even capable of carrying out the instructions at [[Wikipedia:Database_queries#Requesting_that_a_query_be_run]]; I have created an account on the toolserv but its interface is too unfriendly for non-CS person like myself to even be able to file a request there. Smirk if you will, I am a social scientist, my coding knowledge ends at wiki syntax, and the most technical place I can ask for help is here.  Therefore I am looking for help: I require an assistance from someone who can help me run some queries on the database. To be specific with regards to what I need, I have a sample of editors (based on [[Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits]]) and I'd like to get numbers about their contribution to specific pages, such as WP:AN or WP:AE. As you can see, all the data I am looking for is publicly available; my problem is that I don't know how to make it machine-readable (i.e. create a [[.csv]] file or similar, so that I could run some queries of my own in statistical software such as SPSS). Ideally, the results would be distributed by each user on a time scale (monthly or daily), and paired with their total number of edits (so, saying for each editor in the sample that for month X that editor had X edits to AN, Y edits to..., and so on, within Z edits total). I ''know'' we have/had edit counters that could do this by namespace, so I am pretty sure this could be doable for individual pages or sets, too.  Please note that I can cover expenses required in obtaining this data from my research budget (in other words, I can pay for your time, or alternatively, I'd be happy to donate $$ from that budget to WMF, or help you get an article to a Good status, or write a DYK on a topic of your choice...).  Even if you cannot help me with all I am asking here, any advice would be appreciated (as in, if someone can point me to a specific downloadable (?) dataset that contains data I need, it may be easier for me t find somebody who can work on it but cannot find it, and so on). --<sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> reply here</font>]]</sub> 11:47, 1 June 2013 (UTC) :{{reply to|Piotrus}}: You may find the [//toolserver.org/~snottywong/usersearch.html user contribution search] tool useful, but even it may not be powerful enough for your purposes.

In lists with smaller-font text, then consider x16px, or even x15px, when a better fit.

Is true that some leave because it takes a while to learn the rules of the site but its more of a cultural problem with the community than a technical problem. The reason they leave is because a lot of folks in the community treat new editors like shit and block them or badger them before they have a chance to learn the policies. The policies are what makes the site hard, not learning to indent comments on talk pages with a colon or learning a little Wikimarkup or HTML.

But that is not how it started. It morphed into a thought experiment because some of us saw flaws in the methodolgy and assumptions being made with its development. Many of which are still applicable to Flow BTW. I would add too that Flow could work for a lot of Wiki's. Particularly those that are not template dependant. It could be one of those options in Mediawiki that doesn't get deployed here. That would be ok too. No one is saying that it can't be.

Most help-menu options would likely lead to common FAQ pages, where perhaps the top 15 questions would answer the concerns for 85% of new users in that situation. Once people start thinking in terms of the "49 most-common help topics" and the "top 25 questions" (or confusions) for each of those 49 sections (1,225 common issues), then numerous problems tend to become very quick to resolve. The more the new users select among the 49 help options, then the more quickly they would remember how to get online help for specific types of issues. Do you see how that would work, and how new users would gain insight, over time, about 1,225 initially unfathomable issues? -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 01:01, 4 June 2013 (UTC)  == Constant logoff under Safari ==  Some time in the last couple of days, my machine will no longer remain logged in to the Wiki.

As described [[Wikipedia:Notifications/Thanks|on this dedicated page]], we've built a system to thank editors for individual edits. As I'm sure you're all aware, it's relatively trivial to deal with bad contributions (undo and rollback are your friend!) but we don't really have any way in MediaWiki to encourage editors who have made ''good'' edits. We can send out barnstars, sure, but barnstars are justifiably Kind Of A Big Deal - they're for really substantial contributions or a large number of small ones. There's nothing to thank people for individually helpful, gnome-ish edits except dropping a personal note - which is quite a lot of effort to do every time someone corrects a typo.  The Thanks extension solves for this; with it, you can send an editor a notification about the value of their edit with a couple of button-clicks. If you're not a fan, there will be preference options to turn off (respectively) receiving thanks, and seeing the interface elements of the extension at all. You can read more [[Wikipedia:Notifications/Thanks|here]] :).

The notifications themselves look excellent - it is the implementation that looks crappy: the colours and pop-up windows are very not WP-like (maybe that is the start of new WP look?). Not to mention being released apparently without the very minimum of testing (I got a talk message by 1 (one) user and notification about "<username> and 1 other posted on your talk page", while there is no 'other', how can a serious test miss that?) Anyway, get on with it, it looks promising. And the links are weird, with a dotted underline (?) and pop-up hints? Also it looks like I am back 20 years, sometimes pages take 10+ seconds plus to load and they are so full with, I can't be sure, javascript?, that the page keeps on moving around, building up, all the time. It is the back to the 1990s and waiting for those (then) huge pictures to load? To those working hard to improve: thank you for your work, there are some valuable contributions.

The 'white on gray' I find a tad less convincing, it's just inversion in order to make it stand out a bit more. The idea of ajax for post edit is clear, you only want to show it very temporarily, and you don't want to affect the flow of the content any more than required. Personally though, I think it's positioning can be improved and so can it's color scheme. For notifications we have a similar problem. The idea is to give the user many more notifications, configurable and live (so not just when navigating pages). Doing that with plain html is almost impossible to do, while not also aggressively taking away realestate from the content.</br>Also, there is no such thing as html popups. There is html content, ajaxified html content (which can be overlayed on top of other content) and alert dialogs. With the increase in interaction, you will see more ajax based content, simply because it saves you a ton of pageloads. It's only logical. Users who don't want to use ajax, will have to make those many page navigations, but it doesn't make sense for the majority of users if you ask me. Anyway, in terms of design, you will see more Echo, then postedit from what I have seen of projects being discussed.

Having a floating window that does not fit in, actually is a must, otherwise it would be doubly silly: to have a warning that noone can see :-) «''The 'white on gray' [...] it's just inversion in order to make it stand out a bit more» Evidently, and it does stand out, and THAT is the problem :-) Why do we want a "0" (i.e., no news) to stand out? :::::As to «Doing [many notifications] with plain html is almost impossible to do, while not also aggressively taking away realestate from the content.» Why do we need 'many' notifications? And assuming we do, why do they need to be mingled with / on top of the content? Tabbed browsing is perfectly standard nowadays, so we could have a dedicated page, with all the space in the world for notifications (and we already do right?) plus a small warning on the 'main' page (if we really must - which we already do have also). Any editor interested in the notifications would look into the notifications page once in a while, or after getting a warning. The concept of having multiple place-holders (i.e. windows) to differentiate content isn't exactly new :-) I currently have 24 tabs/windows open across 6 workspaces - I bet you do not advise me to try and cram them all in a single window :-) So why exactly do we *need* to a have a loong list of notification on top of content?. :::::«''there is no such thing as html popups''» ? I am missing something there. Yes, there are no html pop ups in WP, but there are html pop-ups, right? <nowiki><a ... target='_top' ...></nowiki> or something? And they were usually frowned upon.

These could do with being re-written in Lua, which will make them faster, and allow us to both increase their usefulness and to detect and warn about errors (similar to the recent re-write of our referencing templates).  It makes sense to do this in a coordinated manner, rather than individually, and to see whether we can give them a common core.   I'm not a Lua coder (I'm interested in learning, but that's a separate issue), but I do understand the various templates' inputs and outputs, and have worked to develop them for several years,   There is also [[Help talk:Citation Style 1#Date formatting and machine readability|discussion of similar date coding]] for the {{para|published}} parameters in reference templates.

Meanwhile, as we have found with the Lua-based [[wp:CS1]] cite templates, people either check the results or they don't, and showing {{color|#CC2211|'''Very long red error messages'''}} has not stopped people from adding more invalid data into Wikipedia articles, whether minor or major pages. Plus showing the glaring red error messages does not force readers to edit and fix the pages, within a few days or weeks, while it only makes articles look trashy for the vast majority of readers, all for what, to say, "April 31 is invalid" where "April 30" should be the value, or who knows what to put there? ...and how does that really help the readers of 81,000 film articles or others? There is no reason to highlight an error in a date which the reader might not even notice, and even if they do, then the readers will realize "April 31" is invalid, without a red-error message to inform their ''[[South Park]]'' "warped little minds" as if the readers were clueless about dates. Another issue we learned from using Lua, in the earlier Lua cites, was how every small tweak to alter or restate the red-error messages (which most readers have ignored) had merely triggered the daily reformatting of 2 million pages (for weeks), which made the Toolserver [[wp:REPLAG]] delay fall days further behind. Plus, what if the Lua rewrite introduces subtle new date-formatting bugs which do not exist now because of current unknown parameter interactions, and all for what? Sorry, I have done the tedious analysis, and I do not see the need to "re-invent the wheel" of date formatting. This is another [[YAGNI]] distraction from high-priority issues. However, thanks for asking, because it sets a clear example for where [[Lua script]] is not needed but risks new bugs, plus red-error scarring of some pages, with massive re-reformatting of 110 thousand related articles, for every update of the Lua versions. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 10:42, 30 May 2013 (UTC) ::Funny, I don't recall asking for "red-error scarring"; your "new bugs" hypothesis is FUD; and your screed ignores the additional functionality which i did propose (and which has been suggested for some time on the talk pages of some of the templates involved). <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 10:49, 30 May 2013 (UTC) ::: It is a rule-of-thumb, in computer work, how 10% of bugfixes cause more bugs, and rewrites are even worse.

I'd be happy to do so in the morning though. [[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]] ([[User talk:Technical 13|talk]]) 02:18, 31 May 2013 (UTC) *: Okay, good morning!  The reason I am opposed to such anonymity is the fact that as a respectable person that respects the process, I do not want to offer a third opinion on a dispute where I'm familiar with either person currently involved.  It is a waste of my time to have to go to the location of the dispute to see who is involved before I decide if I want to say anything or remain silent.  The normal process for such response is to read the dispute, research both claims to try and see it from both perspectives, and respond one way, the other, or with a compromise that may be satisfactory to both and always in a neutral tone.  In the process of leaving a response, it is normal practice to add a reasonable edit summary and check the "Watch this page" checkbox to add it to my watchlist so I can monitor for responses and questions.  So, if there was anonymity amongst both of the other parties (they would have to remove all of their signatures from the talk page as no-one goes into a discussion expecting to need to 3O), and request assistance without a signature, then the responder would be going in not knowing who was involved so they could avoid situations where they know one of the people opening them up to claims of favoritism and sneaky emailing and working behind the scenes in a canvassing way to sway a dispute one way or the other.  I personally wouldn't want to get caught in that kind of mess and would likely quit offering 3Os if I had to work extra hard to find out who was requesting it so that I could know that I do not know either of them and therefor could not be accused of a COI in the dispute.

The project places an ethical obligation on volunteers to be neutral, and the no-sig requirement is really to just help volunteers remain neutral in giving opinions by not knowing who asked for it. In truth, it's usually pretty obvious who made the request, either by the way the request is stated or by the fact that one or the other of the editors says at the article talk page that they're going to ask for a 3O or says that they've done so. The requirement is just a tiny bit of help, nothing more. I'd be opposed to making it more anonymous, however. For one thing, it's probably fruitless for the reasons I've already stated, but more importantly nothing should get posted publicly at Wikipedia which cannot be attributed to the poster. Moreover, 3O is the most "lightweight" of the [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]] processes at WP and 3O's are nothing more than just that: opinions.

The reason I am proposing better anonymity is not mitigated by the facts TransporterMan mentions, because they address what I see as very minor problems to begin with.  Here's a situation where the weak anonymity is a more serious problem:  It's common for one person involved in a 2-person dispute to follow the edits of the other.  If one of them thereby notices the other requested a 3O, that person could ask an ally or meatpuppet or use a sockpuppet to respond to the 3O.  Such a biased 3O goes a long way to supporting a determined POV editor.  If Theo implements the feature I'm asking for, then the follower will likely only know of the 3O request once it's been taken on by a regular.  If providing such biased 3Os is no longer easy, then 3Os become more trustworthy, and more valuable.  Seems like a relatively certain, specific and compelling reason to me.--[[User:Elvey|Elvey]] ([[User talk:Elvey|talk]]) 02:14, 5 June 2013 (UTC) ::::: I'm not sure that is entirely accurate... Of the disputes that I have followed, it is most often that the person in the wrong, who knows they are wrong uses a [[WP:SOCK|SOCK]] account.  The person that is right knows there is something fishy going on and it goes to [[WP:DRN|DRN]].  The people who help out and volunteer in the DRN, often check the backgrounds of all three people involved and see if there is any potential sockpuppetry or meatpuppetry going on and seem to have a high rate of detecting such things.  The sock goes to [[WP:SPI|SPI]] and the DRN case is closed appropriately.  It is my belief that anyone knowledgeable enough to make a sock account to try and prove their point, albeit an extremely '''stoopid''' idea, likely has [[WP:3O]] on their watchlist and will note the 3O request anyways.  So, this doesn't really offer any improvement to the system and like I said above causes an issue with putting reviewers under extra fire for playing favorites despite not knowing who initially involved.  Now, if your idea was to make DRN more anonymous by not having the two disputing parties identified and leaving it up to the 3O responder to decide if they want to be anonymous or not, then I would support that proposal.  The reason I would support that and not the other is because of where the discussion takes place.  In DRN all discussion is localized to the noticeboard and there are often multiple disputes going on at any one time.  This means there are multiple DRN volunteers that will skim over each topic and the likelihood of one of the more experienced ones noticing something is exponentially greater than just the one 3O responder on the article talk page.

The change I'm proposing in no way opens up reviewers to extra fire.  Instead of addressing my proposal, you have twice put up straw men of other ideas that are NOT what I've proposed ("they would have to remove all of their signatures" and "...if your idea was..."), and then shot them down. (A straw man did open up reviewers to extra fire.)  Congrats, those straw men are dead.  So what?  If their flaws were present in my proposal, surely you'd shoot at my proposal instead of your straw men.  You claim to routinely know when someone "knows they are wrong" in a content dispute and yet you can't see inside their heads, and besides, it's certainly not true that most people in a content dispute who are wrong know they are wrong.

In the case of an edit conflict this list is located below the first edit window (therefore between the two edit windows). As it happens that this list grows very long (e.g. on this page) and since it remembers it's state (collapsed or uncollapsed) sometimes I also have to scroll very far to even reach the second edit window, making comparisons impossible (yes, I know, I could just collapse the list first, but I forget that most of the time). Are there any settings / gadgets / custom CSS / custom JavaScript / whatever which solves these problems (at least partially)?

Instead consider how simplistic the full-page preview is: it shows the full latest revision versus your update to the full prior revision, with no attempt to merge the two at all. The auto-correction is not hard to do, but it can be confusing at a human level, of side-by-side comparisons better done by machine algorithms, as merging revision-C after revision-A with revision-D after revision-A, while allowing for other intermediate revisions called "revision-B" after revision-A. Unless all 3 revisions (A/C/D) are compared, then the edit-conflict cannot be accurately reduced to a few sections, because even small changes intended for the prior revision might seem very different against the latest revision.

I suggest a "{Concerned}" tag-box which would state, "Recent edits to this page have raised concerns; see [[Hyperlink|Talk:Xxxx#Concerns]]" and have that link to header "#Concerns" or a header named by parameter {{{1}}}. Hence, even a new editor could redisplay the page, then see the top Concerned tag-box, and read the talk-page link to "==Concerns==" about adding the recent copyvio text. A {Concerned} tag-box should have been developed years ago, as a general notice which even new editors, or editors whose user-talk has been re-MediaWikified, could read as an alert to their edits. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 12:06, 2 June 2013 (UTC) *:Urgh, not more maintenance tags... {{-)}}. However, what you propose are really communication tags, not maintenance tags. What maintenance does such an article need? Since the edits that raised concern have already been undone, the only thing a wikignome finding the tag needs to do is remove the tag! I'm not keen on littering articles with little messages to get the attention of just one or two people editing it. If there are many editors making the same "bad" edits, the page needs an [[WP:editnotice|editnotice]]. Editnotices get the attention of editors without disturbing readers. There's also a strong risk of such tags being left on the article for years (the template could be coded to cause it to disappear from the rendered page after a week or two, though it would still be in the wikitext). – '''[[User:PartTimeGnome|PartTimeGnome]]''' <span style="font-size:79%;">([[User talk:PartTimeGnome|talk]]&#160;&#124; [[Special:Contributions/PartTimeGnome|contribs]])</span> 00:21, 3 June 2013 (UTC) ::: The "maintenance" needed would be to remove the copyvio text if re-added (as explained at the related talk-page link). However, an edit-notice warning of copyvio would also help to deter the active editor(s), but unfortunately, give no alert to readers who might think the copyvio text could be copied, or was approved by "wiki-management". A tag-box template, as {Concerned}, would cover more options, formally logging the copyvio event, and also catch the attention of the editor who had noticed the "old revision" was still there "unchanged" but a {Concerned} tag-box would instead get the attention of the editor, as most definitely a change in the article's appearance after the copyvio text had been removed. Many people would be alerted to the issue. In a sense, working on Wikipedia is like a massive multiplayer chess game, where the strategy involves making moves in combination with all users, including new editors, old editors who fix copyvio problems, people who read an article wondering about copyvio, and people who want to copy an article (unaware copyvio text has been added).

I am hoping people can see that changing Wikipedia into a [[WYSIWYG]] "chalkboard simulator" is not the way forward, because pages, including talk-pages, are word-processing documents which use a [[macro scripting language]] where what-you-see ("WYS") is the template call or function call or calculation, and what-you-get ("WYG") is the computed result of calculating/typesetting the template's output. The WYSIWYG interface is better for young children, who want to scrawl on a chalkboard and edit at that level, whereas Wikipedia can support adults who use transformations of macros into text which does not appear in the original language, such as <nowiki>{{convert|45|ly|km mi}}</nowiki> yielding "{{convert|45|ly|km mi}}" where the word "[[light-years]]" does not even appear in the input data.

Note this is just one mode of access, where also, the original ability to edit the whole talk-page and reply to several topics, during one edit, would still be supported. However, note that paragraph-level edits would still require automatic-merge for edit-conflict of 2 replies, such as [[FIFO]] (first-in, first-out), where the 2nd reply after a paragraph would get inserted after the 1st reply, and in fact, a 3-person edit-conflict would insert reply3 after reply2 (after reply1).<br>So, imagine a talk-page with numerous [e]'s down the page, at each paragraph, and perhaps have a [[Special:Preferences]] option to put "[e]" at the left-side of talk-page text, rather than as all right-side [e]'s. Now, paragraphs would be any ":" or "*" or "#" indent-mark or blank-line break, or perhaps a Special:Preferences to also mark any text break (newline) as a point to show "[e]" to edit that separate line. I understand the paragraph-level talk-page is not the same as [[WYSIWYG]]-edit, and paragraphs generated by templates (or [[Lua script]] modules) would limit access to the top of the template call, but it would be a format that even many new users could handle, by keeping the edit focused on one paragraph at a time (until users were more comfortable with the current section-level [edit] of "==Header==" or whole page). I think that would be fantastic, and solve the new-user frustration about long talk-page texts. Also, by inviting edits to just one paragraph at a time, then edit-conflicts would be limited to just one small portion of a talk-page, as much easier to auto-merge and resolve. After talk-pages, then perhaps introduce paragraph-edits to articles, with an option to just edit the whole page but position initial cursor at that paragraph. Does that sound useful?

This is so that you all know what is happening, and make sure you have as much opportunity to tell us when we're wrong and help guide the priorities for development and improvement:  <div class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"> VisualEditor was updated as part of the wider [[mw:MediaWiki 1.22/wmf6|MediaWiki 1.22wmf6 branch deployment]] on Thursday 6 June. In the ten days weeks since 1.22wmf5, the team worked on new features ahead of VisualEditor's launch as the default way users will edit our wikis in beta.   The most noticeable change for users is that it is now possible to set, edit and remove the categories that a page belongs to and it's "default sort" key, as part of the new "page settings" dialog that can be opened from the button on the toolbar. For now, this dialog covers categories and a simple listing of language links, but will be expanded to cover other "meta-data" like a page having the table of contents disabled, and integration with Wikidata's language links system. Work also continued on the other three critical areas ahead of the release - Templates, References and Images - and we hope to release these in the next week or two.  The way that known browsers are supported changed slightly; browsers are now only blacklisted if we know that they cause significant problems, like Internet Explorer version 8 and below. If your browser is not known, you will get a notice alerting you to this issue ([[bugzilla:38128|38128]]).  We have added further support in our back-end for multi-character "grapheme clusters", which means that wikis that use extended ("non-BMP") Unicode characters can now work ([[bugzilla:48975|48975]]). The left and right arrow keys now move in the correct direction in RTL environments ([[bugzilla:38546|38546]]).  A complete list of individual code commits is available [[mw:MediaWiki 1.22/wmf6/Changelog#VisualEditor|in the 1.22/wmf6 changelog]], and all Bugzilla bugs closed in this period on [//bugzilla.wikimedia.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2013-06-06&product=VisualEditor&list_id=204657 Bugzilla's list] </div>  Per the [[mw:MediaWiki 1.22/Roadmap|MediaWiki deployment roadmap]], this should be deployed here on '''Thursday 13 June'''.

It seems that the WMF is asking for community feedback ''before'' they develop the tool (as opposed to what happened with, say, AFT), which is something we as a community should welcome. But just grumbling about the supposed "features" of the tool here isn't a very productive use of time. If you are concerned that Flow will not allow the use of templates in discussions, then go and have a friendly chat to the developers, see what their side of the story is, and then explain how you disagree with them.

The team actively working on Flow consists of Brandon, who is actively talking through things. Now: yes, we may lose templates. The intention is ''not'' to lose anything by losing templates. What I mean by that is that, largely, templates aren't the end-goal, they're the method; the goal is being able to signify that a user needs help, or is blocked, or...etc, etc. These are things that can be implemented in other ways. Nobody at the WMF end wants to lose the underlying functionality that makes templates useful.

Right now, Brandon ([[User:Jorm (WMF)|Jorm]]) is actively floating ideas on how Flow could work, including potential alternatives to existing workflows. Nothing has been implemented or set in stone yet, and now is a good time for ideas to be tested, kicked around, prototyped and, in some cases, shot down. The whole point of having this discussion early (with only an interactive prototype in existence) is so that issues can be surfaced early in the development. That's a good thing. Give Brandon a chance to respond in a bit more detail, and then we can see if we can come up with an approach that addresses key concerns.--[[User:Eloquence|Eloquence]][[User:Eloquence/CP|*]] 04:46, 2 June 2013 (UTC)  === Response from Jorm === Well, hasn't this been fun! I'm just going to comment on everything here, in a subsection, because REASONS.  Here's your bullet points:  * Yes, you can still warn users.  * Yes, we've made implementation decisions already, based on back-end constraints. * Yes, bots, twinkle, huggle, awb will continue to work. Anyone who says otherwise has been Caught Not Reading. * Yes, you'll still be able to add templates to page boards (though we're not going into Article talk pages yet). There will be a "non-structured" area on every page. Existing templates will likely migrate but again: that's not where we're at right now. * Yes, we're thinking seriously about restricting the ability of allowing anyone to edit other people's comments willy-nilly.  This is a complicated topic and we're thinking through several options.   Okay. To the meat.  I wish this discussion would actually have taken place in the ''multiple'' places provided for it, and I wish that it had been started on a work day, and I wish that it hadn't had several hours to cook and cycle upon itself without a response from me because it's a Saturday and I was at a cook out with my in-laws.  I also wish that there were more assumptions of good faith and trust.    In fact, I think I'm gonna talk about that for a second.  Friday was the third year anniversary of my employment at the Foundation.  That's a really long time in Silicon Valley years and it's more than enough time, I think, that we should drop the whole schtick about "Foundation designers don't know the community" and "they're trying to turn it into Facebook" and "you don't listen to us" and all the other jazz.  I think you'd be ''disturbed'' at how well we understand the processes used by the various wikis and I think you might be saddened if you understood how hamstrung we are in making ''your life better'' because the complexity of the process is hypnotic.  Ask people whether or not [[Special:NewPagesFeed]] isn't an improvement and then ask me how many hours were spent studying how page patrollers work and interviewing patrollers and basically absorbing everything about it.  Was the final product exactly what ''any one'' patroller wanted?  Probably not, but it was closer to what they ''needed''.  If you think - even for a moment - that there are not people who are thinking about and discussing ''every one'' of the problems or issues that have been brought up above, you're wrong.  And if you think that we're working in Bad Faith, there's nothing I or any of us can do for you.    The only thing I can ask you for is ''your input''. I think we've been pretty damned good about trying to communicate and ask for input.  Okay.  Let's start with templates, which I think is what everyone is really freaking out about when it's boiled down.  First, no one has said, ever, "well, we're doing this, and screw you and your processes, you're just out of luck."  In fact, we've been pretty solid about saying "we're going to help you in any way you can".  In fact, "buried" in the global navigation on every Flow portal is a page describing a "Workflow Description Language".  We're planning to give you something to ''replace'' your templated workflows and ''make them better'' and ''easier.''    Second, no one has said, "well, bots and Twinkle and Huggle and AWB people are screwed."  No, they aren't, and I'm frankly finding it hard to jump to that conclusion.  How will Twinkle work?  Simple: we grab the hook off "create section," take the template that it wants to drop, parse it into html, make sure the Parsoid understands it, and create a new Flow Topic with the html as the post text.  That's it!  And even better: the conversation is now managed.  * Ah, but what if - what ''if'' - what if we could make warning a user a real, true workflow?  What if, instead of a spray-and-pray template, we can initiate a workflow that actually tracks how many warnings a user has, makes sure the user has seen ''and acknowledged'' them, and then also provides them with interactive tools to learn about what they did wrong?  Wouldn't that be neat?  Let's now tackle the "devs are making decisions without us" line of thought.    Spoiler: Of course we are.  Absolutely we are.  You, as a community, cannot individually be expected to understand how our software back end works.  Nor can you be expected to understand how to program.  Or have studied human interface design, or even know anything about computers at all. I'm not saying that some of you don't: I know many members of the community do.  I ''am'' saying that it is ''our job'' to know about ''all of those things''.  What this means is that we sit and look at our design constraints and look at what our goals are and how the system (e.g., community processes) works, and how the system will be impacted, and so forth.  We read tea leaves and we think about The Future - not just as it relates to enwiki, but to ''all'' wikis.  Here's the future and I don't think it's a surprise to anyone:  The VisualEditor.  That adds a ''massive'' constraint to whatever design we come up with.  Whatever content gets entered into Flow ''must'' be readable, parsable, and editable within the VisualEditor.  It is simply a ''non-starter'' otherwise.  Currently, the VisualEditor (and Parsoid, which is our real constraint) does not handle templates very well - at least not well enough that we can (at this time) state ''for a fact'' that all templates can be parsed by it.  The fine developers working the VE are hustling to get these things working but the timeline isn't "next week".  Ergo, we can't depend on it, so we have to treat it as a design constraint.  That brings me to the next constraint:  scalability and the Parsoid.  [[mw:Talk:Flow Portal/Interactive Prototype#Please_don.27t_implement_this_28074|I walked through the issues with this before]] and it's a lot of text so I won't repeat it here.  The gist is "running every post through the parser on load is not scalable".  It's just ''not'' possible to do.  We're also not going to be storing the data for Flow posts in the local wikis.  The database structure doesn't allow for it (they're built for horizontal scale, not vertical, and Flow requires vertical scaling).  That means all Flow posts get saved to a different database system (another constraint).  (There's an interesting side-effect to that, but I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure it out. For now.)  Let's walk back from the ledge, people.  This is ''all'' good stuff. I'm not going to lie to you: it's going to be change, and it's going to hurt for a bit, but we'll all get through it.  It might be a fun exercise to sit and think about how many things we can ''fix'' with Flow, rather than how many things are going to change.  This was long.  It's Saturday night. I'm going to spend what remains of it with my wife.  I'll try to be available to answer questions tomorrow (Sunday). I'd ''prefer'' it if these questions were left at [[mw:Flow Portal]], so they're centralized, but I'll talk here as well.--[[User:Jorm (WMF)|Jorm (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Jorm (WMF)|talk]]) 04:52, 2 June 2013 (UTC) :Thanks for the detailed explanation Jorm.

Of course there can be no detail at this stage, but there should be a 20,000 foot overview of fundamental issues like whether Flow will handle standard warnings, and how abusive posts (or spam or trolling) can be removed (hint: asking an admin is not acceptable). The other issues mentioned at [[WT:Flow]] should also be addressed. [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 11:26, 2 June 2013 (UTC) * {{U|Jorm (WMF)}}, thank you for you taking the time to respond here.  Being the one that has opened this discussion here (and a discussion elsewhere questioning the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]]ification of signatures (which I'm not saying is entirely bad)), I want you guys to know that I really am assuming good faith on your (the Foundation's) part (I've even gone out of my way to try and stick up for you in some of these threads like {{Diff|Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)|557731165|557730085|here}}).  I'm far from opposed to change.  As you know, I've been following this discussion on the MediaWiki liquid threads and I've been following as much of it as I can find on Bugzilla (I'm on the mailing lists as well), and trying to ask important questions and understand it in both places and addressing concerns.  I just wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of some of these things and had a chance to offer some more input to the process.  No, I'm not saying they don't have the same ability as myself or anyone else to go to MediaWiki and follow all of it like I have, simply that some may not have the kind of time required to read all of the messages if follow it at all or are simply unaware that it exists there.  The template thing is a huge concern of mine (and apparently others) because there are so many tools that rely on them from Twinkle, Huggle, Snuggle, AWB (less so because it isn't as often used on talk pages) and critical processes such as warnings, help/edit requests, teahouse invitations, wikiproject banners, afc/dyk/fa/deletion/block notifications, etc...  I would love to help in anyway I can to create alternatives or make these functional within Flow before Flow is rolled out...  So, do you think that WMF and the community can work together on this instead of the foundation just saying "hey, we researched everything and we know how your systems work better than you do and this is what we devised based on that..."?  [[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]] ([[User talk:Technical 13|talk]]) 12:12, 2 June 2013 (UTC) ::@Jorm I think there are a lot of flaws with your statements above and with your assumptions in the article about the Athena project linked below. I do think your intentions are pure so I don't want anyone saying I am not assuming good faith but here are a few of my concern which I had last night but saved posting them to let you enjoy your night: ::#First, not posting on a weekend because you don't work on weekends shows a huge lack of understanding about the dynamic and global nature of how the community works. Or a lock of caring. Either way its not a great thing. The community edits 24 hours a day 7 days a week. We should not need to save our comments and concerns for a WMF work day because the primary developer doesn't edit here off work hours. ::#Next the comments about posting at the MW site is pretty much silly and again shows a fundamental lack of understanding about how the community works. The vast majority of the community never edits there and wouldn't even know the discussion was there until it was too late. Even on this page there is a limited number of people who comment and most of those are admins and technical folks. If you want to ensure that few comments are made and make the point later that no one commented so everything must be fine, then hiding the discussions in MediaWiki is a good way to do just that. ::#The technical aspect of the site is much more of a minor problem than the uncivil and toxic nature of how newby's are treated. I agree its a little dated and it could stand some updating but we aren't Facebook and the people who edit here are doing so for different reasons than Facebook or social media so using the mentality that Facebook spent a lot of time and money developing it so it must be good for us as well is fundamentally flawed. ::#The vast majority don't leave because they have trouble learning how to edit. They leave because the community treats them like crap if they aren't born with the knowledge of our rules and some block happy admin blocks them the first time they don't sign their posts or some other stupid thing. If you want to keep editors, work on culture toxicity, not on implementing a secondary talk page discussion system so they have to learn 2 and eliminate make it so we cannot use templates. ::#Another big reason we are losing editors is that they aren't leaving, we are diluting our pool of editors with new projects as the come online. With every new project we add (Wikidata, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, etc.) we lose some editors to this new project. I don't want to sound like these projects are a bad thing because they aren't and that's not what I mean to imply. But it does spread us thinner so our resources don't go as far as far as human capital goes.  ::#You state that no one has said "well, we're doing this, and screw you and your processes, you're just out of luck." Really, isn't that almost exactly what they have said in multiple occasions in the past, including the elimination of the Orange Bar of Doom? Because I distinctly remember at least 2 comments from WMF folks implying exactly that. ::#You also stated "well, bots and Twinkle and Huggle and AWB people are screwed.". Of course there will be a way to work around the problem but these things '''will''' need to have some modifications made to them if this goes through. That modification might need to include just not updating whatever page Flow is displayed on. So although you are correct that no one said they/we are screwed, no one made it clear in any instructions before now that these would not be affected. Additionally, although several of these applications were designed by or supported by people who work at the WMF, none of these applications are actively "supported" by the WMF. So I could easily see the attitude of well we don't support it so its not our problem if it breaks. And it wouldn't be the first time the WMF had this attitude by the way. ::#There are a lot of improvements that Visual editor will bring I agree but it still has a ways to go. Even when it is released, its likely that we will still need an advanced editor in the form of what we have as the current edit capability. ::In summary I'm glad you took the time to post and I very much appreciate that as well as other community members do. But the general tone of your post is that of a general lack of empathy and frankly indicates exactly the problem with the "well, we're doing this, and screw you and your processes, you're just out of luck." comment you made above. [[User:KumiokoCleanStart|Kumioko]] ([[User talk:KumiokoCleanStart|talk]]) 13:58, 2 June 2013 (UTC) :::Wow. That's...certainly something. Let me go through, but by bit. :::#I don't think it demonstrates a lack of understanding about the community; do you think after three years of heavily engaging with the community, Brandon was ''ignorant'' of the fact that we're a global, volunteer-based movement, and that editors can post at any time, from any place? As someone who has worked with him very closely for 2 of those 3 years, Brandon gets it to a degree most staffers don't - to a degree that some ''community-sourced'' staffers don't. He wasn't saying he was ignorant of this community trope; he was saying that, weirdly, staffers sometimes need to take time off. As someone who has done the whole work-90-hours-a-week-every-week-for-a-year schtick, I've started trying to take weekends for myself, too (as this demonstrates, I'm not very good at it). I don't think people get the long hours that staffers work, here. It's not Brandon not understanding the community, it's Brandon understanding that working 120 hour weeks would drive him insane. I have absolutely no desire to wander into the office and find him, mind broken, wandering pantsless around the 6th floor chainsmoking Marlboro Lights and singing 'I Will Survive' over and over again. I doubt anyone else wants that mental image either. If you truly think staffers should be active ''whenever editors are active'' then you're asking for the WMF to be run by [[ELIZA]], because that's the only way we can keep up. :::#Nobody has told you to post on MW.org. Please point me to the bit of Brandon's post where he mentioned MW.org as a venue. We are not ignorant of the difficulties around it; if you look at [[Wikipedia:Page Curation/Engagement strategy|the engagement strategy I wrote for Page Curation]], a project Brandon worked heavily on, you'll see it ''specifically called out'' as a problem. What Brandon meant is that there are several other perfectly good venues for this kind of discussion, one of which is [[Wikipedia talk:Flow|right here on enwiki]]. :::#Citation needed for your third statement? I'll agree that a big chunk of people who register in the data as 'editors who leave' leave because of community toxicity. This is nothing to do with the relative difficulty of overcoming toxicity versus overcoming technology, it's to do with poor science; by definition, everyone who edits and then leaves can handle editing. When we look at surveys of ex-contributors or that sort of data, or just anecdotes, of course we're going to be biased towards people who grok markup and leave for other reasons. People who don't grok markup can't participate in the observations. :::#No comment on diluting the pool, really, except to say that we're talking about Wikimedia-wide data on editor decline, not enwiki-specific data. We're not losing them, as you note. :::#We're not talking about the orange bar of death, or any of the other occasions. We're talking about Flow, let's be clear. You may as well tar the development process with the IEP brush, if the approach that you're taking is one where prior actions are complete predictors of future actions taken by a different set of people. :::#Sure, they'll need some modifications. We know this; I spent about 40 hours writing up use cases for everything we'd need to support in the existing talkpages - not just twinkle or huggle, but the underlying mechanisms, like having a good external API for Flow and making sure that we reach out to the volunteer developer community and provide clear instructions and help with such things. :::In summary, I don't see Brandon's post as indicating a lack of empathy; honestly, if he didn't appreciate the feelings the community had do you think we'd be ''having'' this conversation, let alone making plans to ensure things like Twinkle support work? If he didn't care - if we didn't care - here's what would happen. We'd keep all the documentation on MediaWiki.org, we'd have built the software already around our utopian community workflows, we would've silently deployed it, and, absent bugzilla reports, not given a brass farthing what anyone said. That's quite clearly not what we've done. I'm sat here at 6pm on a Sunday evening writing out a ludicrously long counter-counter-argument to follow your counter-argument to another staffer's argument because ''We want to keep people informed about and involved in the process''. And that counter-argument I'm responding to is, depressingly, one that alternately argues our culture is toxic and states basically that "well you should be contributing whenever an editor contributes, then. Any alternative just means you don't care about us". I'm disappointed by the cognitive dissonance I'm seeing here. :::As I've offered before, Kumioko (and I hope you'll take the offer up, this time); if you want to discuss the factors at play here, or Flow generally, I'm certainly willing to free up an hour for a skype call or a google hangout. The same goes for any other editor who wants to talk through...well, whatever they want, really. [[User:Okeyes (WMF)|Okeyes (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Okeyes (WMF)|talk]]) 16:53, 2 June 2013 (UTC) ::* {{U|KumiokoCleanStart}}, I think that while most of your statements are how you personally ''feel'' towards the WMF team and may be written based upon good intent, they are mostly unfounded and most of them are completely unfair in my opinion.  There really is a big gap in the communications between ''them'' and ''us'', and I agree that needs to be addressed.  I view a large part of your comment as flaming and bashing of the WMF team and I commend them for their efforts to bite their tongues as well as they have been.  Finally, I would really appreciate it if you would do something about your username, I find it disruptive and counter productive... I am ''barely'' aware of whatever you had to go through before, but that being said, having the username of "KumiokoCleanStart" and not actually changing your ways implies to me that you really do not wish to have a clean start.  Anyways... That is between you and the admins, I just wish you would stop being so disruptive and every comment being to complain or mock or flame someone else.  I implore you to look in the mirror and ask yourself how you can improve yourself.  Now, since I expect something of a "[[WP:ADR|With all due respect]] Technical 13" response from you for this comment, I would like to make sure that you know ahead of time, it would be a waste of time... [[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]] ([[User talk:Technical 13|talk]]) 17:45, 2 June 2013 (UTC) :::*Actually I have met Brandon (although I'm certain he couldn't pick me out in a crowd) and quite a few of the other folks at the WMF and harbor no hard feelings or ill will towards any of them. I found most of them to be very collegial and personable. I also think that some of my statements above are being taken out of context which doesn't really surprise me much either. Clearly I must be the only one who has issue with the comments from Brandon above. I have no doubt that he and the WMF folks mean well but frankly, given the changes that have occurred lately, I wanted to make sure my comments were out there. If they choose to listen and consider my comments or ignore them or if you and others think I am a nut, that's fine. Just remember this discussion a few months from now when Flow comes out because I have enough experience in the IT field as a project manager to see the writing on the wall. So since the comments seem to indicate my input is not wanted or needed I am going to move on and go back to editing. Let them release Flow, break all the templates and cause problems for the admins. Not my problem anymore. I have voiced my concerns and said my piece. There is nothing more I can do since its clear that nothing I say is going to be taken seriously anyway, I'm just wasting my time. Which is IMO not a unique issue with me and a byproduct of the culture here in the project. I'm not an admin nor a member of the WMF so as '''just''' an editor, and not a particularly popular one at that, my opinions are of little interest or impact. The reason I keep bringing up the bit about the culture is, strangely, I don't see anything being done about it. Lots of talk about Facebook like pages and making it easier to edit, but the only comments about the culture are directed at me and how your tired of me bringing it up. If your tired of hearing it, then do something about it rather than kick the can down the road. I analyze things, that's what I do and I often offer suggestions to fix it. But I can't make the changes. Hell I can't do a lot of things around here to help out that I would if I could. Because we are more worried about keeping the power in the hands of a few, than enabling editors to edit and buildup the site. That is the problem with our culture. We are driving the editors off with our actions. Not because they can't figure out editing. If you want to retain editors. Look at fixing those issues first. Otherwise your just putting makeup on a pig! No matter how pretty and easy you make the site, if people are still being shitty to one another, they ain't gonna stay because it looks like Facebook. :::*As for my username this is hardly the place but since you brought it up I'll explain it again. I tried to create a new one and was blocked for socking from an overzealous admin. Then I edited as an IP and once again I had editors crying that I was socking. So I recreated this username and yes I am poking some fun at a lousy policy (clean start) because it doesn't work. Our other policies and culture prevent if from working. If you have to link your old account name to your new one its not a clean start. Frankly if I knew what I now know that I wouldn't be allowed to edit as an IP or create a new name I would have kept the old one with the vast majority of my edits and edit history. But its too late to change it back so now were all stuck with this one. Happy editing and there's no bother replaying to my comments. I'm not going to get involved in the discussion anymore. You all can talk about how wonderful Flow is going to be without my interventions.

I also wish that there were more assumptions of good faith and trust.''''  :::::: As I said above, few of us watch '''the other''' places so there should be little surprise that no one is commenting there. There is no reason for this to '''Start''' or happen on a WMF work day, disussions often cook here and fester and boil. If the WMF is not keeping the members of the community in the loop, things will get blown out of proportion because '''the WMF''' isn't relaying that information. If you write a 3 sentance description about Flow and in it say things like Signatures and templates won't work with no explanation of why or how that will be worked around, don't get mad at me or others because we call you out on it. This is an opportunity for growth and development for all of us. We can take everything offensively or take the comments in these discussions as an opportunity for improvement. Lastly certainly I think everyone understands that Brandon and anyone else should get to spend time with their family. No one and certainly not me would have though the less of him if he would have left a comment saying I will comment in detail on Monday I am spending time with the family. I'm glad he left the detailed comment and I am sure he was frustrated at the situation as are we all. But many of his comments raised more conerns and I commnted on them. I got to where I am in my real life because I don't suger coat things and I don't generally hide behind politics. If I see something wrong I work to address fixing it. I am not shy, timid or calculating. I am blunt and often times in text only environments it comes off as abbrasive. Its not meant to be. It doesn't change the problem though.

The VisualEditor is good for convenience and for the less technical among us. However, there are various tasks that would be impossible with a WYSIWYG editor (editing parser functions, CSS, JS, Lua scripts, ...), and other tasks might be harder using WYSIWYG. Furthermore, the VisualEditor cannot work without JavaScript; the source editor provides a fallback for editors unable or unwilling to run scripts.

Some people want it all in one spot and only one spot. Some people want each communication placed in a topic-appropriate location and then mentioned in numerous other places (often leading to fragmented conversations at each external "pointer" eg this one which started as a pointer to Mediawiki). Some people want mass-duplication of ''anything'' relevant, pasted to ''everywhere'' potentially relevant (eg the 3 Flow portals at mediawiki/meta/here). ::Add to which: Some people are reluctant to leave their "home" wiki, for a variety of reasons. ::On En.Wp alone, we have all of these: [[WP:Dashboard]] and [[Template:Noticeboard links]] (compendiums), [[WP:Wikipedia Signpost]], [[WP:CBB]], Site notices, watchlist notices, [[WP:Update]], etc ::Then the meta/foundation/mediawiki wikis, and their various structured locations for centralized or separated discussion.

He was hired by this company to redesign their product language model. When he arrived he was witness to a ton of old technology and already smelled trouble. He then designed a new replacement language, that handled everything the old language did, and added a ton of new functionality in the language. It also included an editor, with autocompletion, syntax highlighting and validation, preview rendering etc. His first draft was reviewed. They loved it, but then came responses like: but how are we going to find the line number of this piece of block ? He answered line number? what would you need that for ? Well, we still need it to run on our 80x40 (column x lines) based storage system (small detail, why would you ever spec that... :D ). Turns out their entire storage reference system was based on their old display and interface formats (old Vax systems). He then gave them the only logical answer; if you want to keep using your 80x40 storage system, you better keep using what you have right now, there is nothing modern that will ever map on it. The real question is, why do you want to keep such a storage format, and not invest into replacing it, so that you can use this great new language that could make your products so much more flexible and your people so much more efficient ? The engineers protested loudly about all the systems that they would need to replace and all instability it would bring. My colleague concluded: there is nothing I can do for you, not a single language I design will help you any further.<br />We shouldn't have the problem you describe, but we definitely don't want the problem I just described either. The balance has to be somewhere in between. The company in question is almost bankrupt now btw.

I'd like to clarify a few things: you mention we will be able to use templates on Flow boards, and there will be a non-structured area on each page. Am I correct in my understanding that templates will only be allowed in the non-structured area, and not in regular posts? :You also mention that Flow will still be able to use templates from things like Twinkle (albeit internally expanded into HTML). Why can't the same approach be used for comments from editors? Will the ability to use templates in a discussion only be available using the API? :The expansion of templates into HTML effectively means every template would be [[Help:Substitution|subst'd]]. If this were allowed for editor comments, the automatic substitution might confuse editors who re-edit their comments and find they don't look the same, especially if a template has expanded into something lengthy and complex. This could be solved by storing the original wikitext alongside the expanded HTML; the edit page would show the original wikitext and generate new HTML upon saving. :In many of your comments you appear to say that Flow can replace the functionality of all existing templates. Though this might be true for templates that form part of various workflows (RFCs, warnings, edit requests, etc), what about other templates? Various convenience and formatting templates are frequently used in general discussion, such as {{tl|code}}, {{tl|diff}}, {{tl|small}}, {{tl|smiley}} and {{tl|tracked}}. There's also {{tl|tl}}, which I heavily used in the previous sentence. Another common use of templates is demonstration, either to demonstrate the use of a template, or to give an example of a proposed edit to an article (I'm assuming templates will still be allowed in articles). How will we do these things with Flow? – '''[[User:PartTimeGnome|PartTimeGnome]]''' <span style="font-size:79%;">([[User talk:PartTimeGnome|talk]]&#160;&#124; [[Special:Contributions/PartTimeGnome|contribs]])</span> 23:03, 2 June 2013 (UTC) ::Templates will be allowed in the non-structured area, yes.  Or, at least, that's the current thinking.  And no, not in the regular posts. ::I'm simplifying what will happen significantly but yes, the principle aligns with "substing" everything that goes in.  The reason this works for API edits and not "website" edits is that API edits do not (currently) run through anything that the VisualEditor deals with.  If the only way for website edits to happen is through the VE, then only VE-pure code happens. ::Now, I'm going to be honest: it's highly likely that many templates left by Twinkle and other applications ''will'' break.  But, as we've done before with other projects, we will be working with the maintainers of those tools to make sure that things are seamless and will require little or no effort from the editor community to account for the changes. ::This is not our first time at this rodeo.  As it were. ::And yes: technically, we will probably store a "wikitext" version of the page. But that version of the page should be considered "cold storage" and not accessible in the moment to moment use of the software (for the performance issues outlined above). ::And regarding the templates you described above:  roughly half of those templates either are (or should be) natively supported by the VisualEditor, though in other formats (like linking to diffs, or creating font size changes, or source code).  Others (smiley) could be trivially implemented with an emoji generator, and the "tracked" template is an ideal candidate for conversion to a Flow workflow. ::In other news, I'd still like it if these questions were moved to [[WP:FLOW]].--[[User:Jorm (WMF)|Jorm (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Jorm (WMF)|talk]]) 00:38, 3 June 2013 (UTC) :::Okay, the templates I mentioned are supported by VisualEditor. Can the same be said for the hundreds of other formatting/convenience templates used on talk pages? Templates allow regular editors to define new ways to format text that other editors can easily reuse. With VisualEditor, any new formatting options would need to be added by a developer. :::Also, you didn't mention how templates or proposed article edits can be demonstrated in Flow. If I wanted to say "template ''foo'' will look like ''bar'' when used with parameters ''baz'' and ''qux''", I would typically invoke the template in place of ''bar''. How would I say this in Flow? :::I think the main problem here is this fixation on the VisualEditor. The VisualEditor is a great idea and I support it, but it can never hope to do all the things we do in wikitext, not even on talk pages. As I read it, the main reason you are saying "no templates" is because the VisualEditor does not support it. Furthermore, its dependence on JavaScript means some editors cannot use it.

Of course, if [[wp:Flow]] become unbearable, then people could always resort to using WP essay pages as talk-pages (essay "[[Talk:RMS Titanic|Talk of RMS Titanic]]"). Even the mere suggestion that templates used in [[wp:FLOW]] pages would be subst'ed to HTML is horrific. Perhaps the first horror would be a long template that generates extensive markup such as <nowiki>{{bg|#ccc|This}}</nowiki> which shows "{{bg|#ccc|This}}" but would insert <nowiki>"<span style="background-color: #ccc">This</span></nowiki>" for every {bg} in a Flow page. Then there is also the pesky trouble of including a calculation adding 20 numbers and reducing the talk-text to only the final result, not easy to modify for adjusted numbers. However, the elephant in the room, for subst'ing templates in Flow pages would be the inability to upgrade system-wide style templates to, retroactively, back-apply the new style into older Flow pages. Templates are not just simple typesetting styles, but rather they are the way to quickly update the population counts of 2,700 towns/cities in Austria, by editing just 10 templates. And they are, also, the way to style [[wp:WikiProject]] banners, so all pages could show a similar style, even when enhanced to a new system-wide style in the future. In general, people must understand the concept of a [[macro scripting language]] and why the word "macro" is so critically important to easily reading and maintaining data in a word-processing system, and remember that talk-pages are in this same word-processing system.

I think it would be much more productive to fix the numerous problems with auto-merging of edit-conflicts, both for talk-page replies and for multiple insertions near the same lines in article texts. Some of that work could be called "FLOW" while using the current talk-pages, but with FLOW extensions. Even if the edit-conflicts are not fixed with a [[formal proof of correctness]], yet some [[heuristic]] methods could be used to auto-correct most edit-conflicts. I have already noted the need for [[test-and-set]] logic, by read-locking the page each time a "new section" is appended, to avoid adding 2 conflicting endings to the same prior revision. Otherwise, wp:FLOW can sound like a scary delusion mistaken about how talk-pages are actually used. The reality is that many talk-pages contain portions of article text, with templates and footnotes, and some cases keep re-revising that text for later use in live articles.

Can we see that please?  In particular, there's talk about whether templates will be allowed or not. Is it just templates or all Wiki markup? One of the primary purposes of talk pages is to talk about their linked pages. In order to discuss edits to the main page, you need to be able to reproduce those edits as closely as possible in the talk page. This includes basic things like text style, size, color, etc. and well as linking to other wiki pages (in various namespaces), interwiki links, and links to web pages. If these are not supported with the same syntax as now, can't they be made to be? If they're not supported at all, of course, it seems like a non-starter.  There are lots of templates that are used to make discussions more clear ({{tlf|tl*}}, {{tlf|bg}} et. al., {{tlf|in5}}, {{tlf|done}}, off the top of my head; some not-so-important ones). Are there replacements for each of them?  I'm all for making it easier for newbies to use talk pages, and solving the threading/indenting issues that are now so confusing to them (and us), but, at the core of it, these pages are still about editing wiki pages and, to implement them without wiki markup seems like it will always provide less than what is needed. <font color="red">—&#91;</font>[[User:AlanM1|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><font color="green">Alan</font><font color="blue">M</font><font color="purple">1</font></span>]]([[User talk:AlanM1|talk]])<font color="red">&#93;—</font> 22:32, 9 June 2013 (UTC) :Re: gap analysis: See [[mw:Flow Portal/Use cases]] and the other pages linked in the sidebar there.  :Re: templates, I'm not sure, but given that it's still being designed at the moment, I'm sure we'll be able to influence the direction it grows in, and the features that it includes.
